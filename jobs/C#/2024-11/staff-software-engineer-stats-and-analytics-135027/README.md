We empower hundreds of digitally-focused companies to deliver outcomes and exceptional campaign performance everyday. StackAdapt was founded with a vision to be more than an advertising platform, itâ€™s a hub of innovation, imagination and creativity.

  

StackAdapt is the no. 1 performing programmatic advertising platform helping brands accelerate customer engagement and acquisition. This state-of-the-art platform is where some of the most progressive work in machine learning meets cutting-edge user experience.

We're seeking a Staff Engineer to help lead our growing backend engineering team. Our real-time advertising bidding system handles over 3,000,000 requests per second and stores several terabytes of data every day. Our technologies include Go, Ruby on Rails, Aerospike, Redis, Elasticsearch, Kafka, RocksDB, Redshift, ScyllaDB, GraphQL and others. We're not afraid to test and try new technologies.

  

 **About the Team:**

The Stats & Analytics team at StackAdapt is responsible for managing the end-to-end data lifecycle, from ingesting diverse data types such as engagement events (impressions, clicks) and conversion data (purchases, website visits) to distributing this data across critical downstream services like reporting, billing, bidding, and analytics. We also ensure that this data is accessible for offline use, supporting data warehousing, client reporting, and custom dashboards.

  

Our team tackles complex distributed system challenges, focusing on scalability, performance, reliability, and data consistency. We leverage a modern tech stack that includes Golang for high-performance services, TiDB for scalable SQL databases, Redshift and Snowflake for data warehousing, Kafka for real-time streaming, Elasticsearch for powerful search and analytics, and HDFS for distributed storage. If you're passionate about solving large-scale data problems and working with cutting-edge technologies, the Stats & Analytics team offers an exciting opportunity.
