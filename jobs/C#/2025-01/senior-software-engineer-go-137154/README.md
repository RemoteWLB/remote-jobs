**What do we do?**

Paddle offers SaaS companies a completely different approach to their payment infrastructure. Instead of assembling and maintaining a complex stack of payments-related apps and services, weâ€™re a Merchant of Record for our customers. That means we take away 100% of the pain of payment fragmentation. Itâ€™s faster, safer, cheaper, and, above all, way better.

Weâ€™re backed by investors including KKR, FTV Capital, Kindred, Notion, and 83North and serve over 3000 software sellers in 245 territories globally.

**The role:**

As a Senior Software Engineer in our Payments and Checkout Group, youâ€™ll be developing features, testing hypotheses and rolling out changes to improve payment acceptance and checkout conversion. Working closely with your team, you will impact how our Payments and Checkout technologies perform for our customers.

  
Youâ€™ll get to collaborate with multiple teams, alongside engineers, product managers, and designers. Getting involved in a wide range of areas which will provide you with plenty of opportunities to develop your own skills and ultimately grow your career as a valued member of the engineering team.

 **What you'll do:**

  * Be a part of our Payments and Checkout group, working on projects that aim to improve payment acceptance, checkout conversion, global compliance and local acquiring. Using data, youâ€™ll have the opportunity to directly influence the team's success.

  * Contribute high-quality Go code in a large codebase, in both existing and brand new services

  * Collaborate on features to a high standard from initial concept and planning, right through to rollout, with other engineers and non-technical colleagues, and with excellent written and verbal communication

  * Level-up the teamâ€™s engineering practices through mentoring other engineers, and by leading the technical planning of team initiatives

  * Help to continuously improve the reliability and scalability of Paddleâ€™s high-traffic event-driven system

  * Improve the teamâ€™s software quality by implementing automated tests, and also by having an eye for edge-cases and system design

  * Practise DevOps: youâ€™re responsible for getting your code to production, supporting and monitoring its performance, and helping to keep our AWS infrastructure efficient

 **We'd love to hear from you if you:**

  * Have a solid development background with Go

  * Have experience designing and building systems to handle high traffic at scale in a cloud-based environment in AWS

  * Are someone who enjoys collaborating with our technical and non-technical departments

  * Have a proactive attitude towards finding ways to improve the code and team processes

  * A strong understanding of the development process - from design through to deployment, maintenance, and what that means for day-to-day development

  * Are someone who takes pride in what you build

  * Are interested in what new tools and techniques you could introduce to us!
