# [Infrastructure Engineer (Scrum Master)](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/infrastructure-engineer-scrum-master)  
### Nava  
#### `ðŸŒŽ remote,Remote`  

## Description

 **Position Summary**

Nava is at the forefront of reimagining how our government serves its people, and weâ€™re looking for experienced infrastructure engineers to help drive this mission forward. You'll be responsible for pushing the limits of these critical systems, from Billion User Load Tests to achieving and maintaining sub-millisecond transaction times. By doing this, youâ€™ll help ensure that Nava continues delivering services that millions of Americans depend on. You care deeply about working on technology that affects peopleâ€™s lives, and are passionate about building and maintaining large-scale systems that are well-designed, fast, scalable, and secure.

  

You will be working within the government ecosystem, which means working, sometimes closely, with other government contractors and civil servants. Working with people outside of your company means you'll likely encounter different working styles and cultural norms. At the same time, working as part of a larger team allows us to deliver on projects of larger scale and complexity. The government also imposes a level of bureaucracy that is typically not present in a company of our size in the private sector. We operate in a regulated environment, where checks and compliance is built into the process of building software. This can make the path to production slower and some decisions, such as tools and processes, lie outside of our control. However, beyond writing code, finding and recommending ways to improve the way government software is built is one of the highest-leverage ways we help fulfill our mission.

  

You will be working with legacy systems. While our work is to build new systems with up-to-date technology, we have to do that within an existing ecosystem. Our work is building functional, resilient software for production. We don't build flashy prototypes that don't work for real people. This usually means getting to know legacy systems, often with poor documentation and unreliable narrators, and trying to determine how to replicate the systems' behavior or how to integrate with these systems. This is a great opportunity for engineers who enjoy software archaeology. If you care deeply about how software systems work over time, and building systems for longevity and resilience, this work is for you. These responsibilities support Navaâ€™s culture and mission: Be Active Stewards, Pursue the Root Cause, Think Long-Term, Build Together, Inclusion is Essential and Progress Takes Work.
