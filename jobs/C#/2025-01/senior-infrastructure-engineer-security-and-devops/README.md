## Description

The company

  

Kodex builds **software to help private companies respond to lawful data requests from governments**. Our founders have seen firsthand how difficult it is for the public and private sectors to work together to **prevent real-world harm while respecting user privacy**. Ad-hoc processes and impromptu tooling lead to slow response times and overproductions, and risk exploitation by bad actors. Kodex was founded to solve these problems.

  

The platform

  

Kodex provides a **case management solution for Law Enforcement Response** and Trust and Safety teams that enables them to manage workflows, communication, and secure file transfers with law enforcement and government agencies. Our platform offers end-to-end encryption, full audit trails, submission portal with requestor verification, transparency reporting, and API integrations for a complete legal response solution. We enable companies to manage and respond to millions of data requests **securely and on time**.

  

The role

  

This is a full-time remote role for a software engineer. We all have the job title **Senior Infrastructure Engineer** , but we're hiring for the levels E5 (senior), and E6 (staff).

  

If you already have experience with **legal compliance, trust and safety, or law enforcement response teams** , that's great! If not, you should be ready to drink from the firehose.
