## Description

üòé **Our Culture**

Quantum Metric's number one objective is happy people, diverse and inclusive culture. We‚Äôre passionate about empowering our people to become the best version of themselves, offering coaching and training programs designed to accelerate their career in whatever direction they choose.

  

As a remote-first company, we understand the importance of building an engaged, diverse, and fun place to work. We hold regular company-wide events, seasonal challenges, and Quantum Metric sponsored local outings when Zoom becomes too much. We also have a number of Employee Resource Groups that provide spaces to discuss, share, and reflect on topics that impact us both inside and outside of work - from being new to SaaS or navigating it as a first-time parent, to overcoming the barriers faced as Black, Hispanic, Asian American and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, LGBTQIA or other underrepresented backgrounds.

We are also passionate about the connections we build with our customers. You‚Äôll not only work with some of the world‚Äôs most recognized brands, but build lasting relationships.

  

At Quantum Metric we value all types of experience and education and don‚Äôt expect you to meet every qualification for this position. We are most interested in the unique perspective you can bring and your ability to uphold our values of passion, persistence, and integrity.

  

As a Senior Software Engineer, you will build the customer-facing application of our business using React with MobX, GraphQL, D3, and advanced browser APIs. You will build the components and interactions that thousands of users rely on to understand their data and make informed decisions. You will work with both product, design, and field teams to take features from idea to a polished and performant product.

  

We‚Äôre not shy about our rapid pace. We‚Äôve experienced incredible victories because we come up with bold solutions and have them built before our competitors have poured their morning coffee. You understand that the common way to solve a problem is occasionally not the best way, and you want to innovate. You‚Äôll need to learn quickly, fail fast, communicate often, pivot gracefully, grow from your mistakes and iterate.
