## Description

 **Who we are**

  

Hallow is on a mission to help people pray. We‚Äôre the No. 1 prayer app in the world, with more than 700 million prayers prayed across 150+ countries. We're building a product that is authentically Christian and Catholic, while at the same time a resource for anyone looking to grow deeper in a relationship with God. We believe that people are hungry for peace, and that there is no surer way to find it than by learning to sit in silence with Christ: ‚ÄúCome to me, all you that are weary and are carrying heavy burdens, and I will give you rest‚Äù (Mt 11:28).

  

Our goal is to build something truly great. Something that combines the beauty of the Church's spirituality with world-class product and content execution. And we need a world-class team to make it happen.

  

We launched the app in December 2018 and have been blown away with the incredible growth & traction. Hallow has been downloaded more than 22 million times with over 250,000 5-star reviews. We're blessed to be backed by some of the best mission-driven investors in the world and are excited to build out the team to help a lot more folks grow closer to God.

  

We are a startup. We move quickly. We are small but we take big swings. Each person is responsible for making an impact. It is hard‚Äîbut deeply meaningful‚Äîwork. We'd be honored & humbled if you'd consider joining us.

  

 **Tldr:** We are scaling up our product team and looking for someone to help us test all new features on the app and web before they are released.

### What You'll Do

*  **Test the App & Website:** Work closely with our dev team to test out new features on the app and website as soon as they are completed to ensure they are working properly, are of high quality and maintain data integrity.
*  **Test Case Management:** Work with our product team to determine the types of tests we should implement for new features, releases, and more.
*  **Automate Test Cases:** Plan and maintain automated test cases with an eye toward CI/CT with our internal tooling to ensure existing functionality is tested continuously as new features are developed.

### What You'll Love

*  **Mission:** This work is incredibly humbling. Every day we hear amazing stories and we get the pleasure of working on something that‚Äôs impacting lives. One of our favorite user quotes: ‚ÄúI hate quoting an old, overused cliche, but I‚Äôve been very lost. And I think for the first time in a while I may be found.‚Äù
*  **Ownership:** When a company is this small, every employee is a core team member with an outsized impact. You'll own the entire codebase for your vertical within a product pod from start to finish.
*  **Growth:** You‚Äôll get to journey with a VC-backed Silicon Valley startup in hyper-growth mode. who is expected to help build the company as a whole as we settle into a culture and continue to expand the team. From day 1, you‚Äôll be a part of the startup journey. We went from less than 10 to over 100 in the past few years, and we‚Äôll need your help to create a world-class team and get individuals praying in more countries around the world.
*  **Flexibility:** We operate as a largely remote team with members all over the globe. This role is a remote role except for our couple in person company planning meetings each year. We don‚Äôt care when or where you work just that it gets done. That being said, our HQ is in Chicago and if in person work is something you are interested in we‚Äôd love to have you there!
*  **Comp:** We pay competitive market rates both in terms of equity, cash, & benefits. 

  

### What We're Looking For

*  **Passion:** First and foremost, we‚Äôre looking for someone excited and passionate about our mission. It makes it a lot more fun to actually care about what you‚Äôre working on!
*  **Experience:** Attention to detail with regards to design and crafting user interfaces is the single most important attribute we'll look for; Clear and concise communication with detailed notes will be extremely important for tracking and reporting bugs; Great organizational skills will be important to track QA across multiple platforms and in the bug creation and tracking process; Experience in QA or Testing is a big plus, especially experience with testing mobile apps; Experience in a Scrum environment is a plus
*  **Grit:** A start-up is tough and we really care about what we‚Äôre doing. You'll be jumping into a role in a fast moving team, perseverance and adaptability are important.

  

We are honored that you'd consider joining the team and look forward to connecting with you.

  

Best,
