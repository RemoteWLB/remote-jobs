## Description

Join Archive in our mission to change consumer behavior for the better. If you think humans buy too much stuff and throw too much away, then this problem is for you. Weâ€™re starting with fashion and expanding from there.

  

Archive is the leading technology platform for branded resale. The company works with more than 50 global brands including The North Face, Diane von Furstenberg and New Balance, to develop innovative resale programs that keep products out of landfill.

  

Concretely, this means more brands with resale programs, and more consumers buying and selling used things. Fashion is 8% of global emissions and 20% of global wastewater, and has a huge negative human rights footprint, among other issues. Help us chip away at this problem and make an positive impact in this world with us!
