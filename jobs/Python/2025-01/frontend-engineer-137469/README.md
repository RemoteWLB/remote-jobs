## Description

 **What we're doing**

Owning a home is a foundational part of building financial security and wealth in America. However, the tools and technology that support homeownership are antiquated, dependent on things like fax machines, handwritten documentation, and hours of manual review.

  

We're here to change it.

  

Vesta is the next-generation system of record to power the multi-trillion mortgage market. We believe that we are overdue for a core transformation â€“ that in order to build a fully automated process and fully digital customer journeys, lenders will have to adopt a system of record platform that is modern, open, and orchestrated by best-in-class software workflows.

  

 **Who we are**

Our founding team is no stranger to the complexities of the financial industry. As early employees at Blend, they spent years together focused on creating modern cloud infrastructure for banks. Now, with Vesta, they are transforming the mortgage industry by creating the most flexible, open, and automated origination experience, benefitting financial institutions and their customers.

  

And, we're not alone.

  

We've raised $55M from top tier investors, including Andreessen Horowitz, Bain Capital Ventures, Conversion Capital, Zigg Capital, and Index Ventures.

  

We believe that our team is our greatest competitive advantage and take pride in having a team of exceptional humans. As a team, we value humility, empathy, self-awareness, and an orientation towards action. If this sounds like you and you're excited by the idea of getting in at the ground level to be part of building the infrastructure that will power the future of the finance industry, we would love to hear from you!

  

 **Who you are**

You are someone who loves building software that delights users and may be interested in founding a company of your own some day. An ideal candidate for this role is a React expert and has experience scaling up the frontend by investing into the platform and building up the design system in collaboration with the design team and other engineers. You are excited about the breadth of responsibility and autonomy. You are someone who people can depend on to get things done and take responsibility for your commitments. You love working alongside smart and talented people who are execution oriented.

  

 **About your role**

You'll be expected to work generally where the product's needs are strongest. In addition to development, you'll be responsible for helping set the guidelines and frameworks for our engineering organization in the years ahead, including both technical tooling and organizational growth.

  

Because the responsibilities of this role are so open-ended, there is no hard and fast list of requirements, but some areas of experience that may be relevant are listed below:
