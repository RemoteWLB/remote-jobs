## Description

 **About Starburst**

  

At Starburst, we are working to dismantle the status quo of data silos and vendor lock-in every single day. For decades, database companies have held their customers hostage and we believe thatâ€™s just plain wrong. Starburst offers a full-featured data lake analytics platform, built on open source Trino. Our platform includes all the capabilities needed to discover, organize, and consume data without the need for time-consuming and costly migration projects. Today more than 300 leading organizations trust us to make better decisions faster.

  

Though Starburst has raised $414M in venture funding from top investors, we were founded in a rather unusual way as we bootstrapped the business with customers and revenue from the very beginning! We are a remote-first company with employees all over the world and are proud to be named a Best Place to Work. Come join our team of All-Stars!

  

 **About the role**

A key value driver for Starburst is its streamlined, easy-to-use, delightful user interfaces and workflows. As a Frontend Software Engineer developing solutions in the Starburst Engineering organization, youâ€™ll share ownership of building out the user experience. Youâ€™ll work closely with UX, and product management to design and build the back-end and front-end components to implement new features our customers will love. Daily tasks include developing and supporting new and existing product features, working with fellow engineers around the world, learning new technologies, designing complex systems, and collaborating with various stakeholders across the organization.
