 **The Role**

  

Link is a pillar in the Veeva system landscape that envisions "Connecting life sciences and key people to improve research and care." Our product offers real-time academics, social, and medical data to build comprehensive profiles. These profiles help our life-science industry partners find the right experts to accelerate the development and the adoption of new therapeutics. We accelerate clinical trials and equitable care. We are proud that our work helps patients receive their most urgent care sooner.

Your work will shape the product roadmap for the entire family of Link products, especially newer products such as Link for Trials. You will design and create an end-to-end pipeline to extract predefined categories of information from big unstructured data in multi-domain and multi-lingual setups. You will have access to cloud infrastructure to develop your model and support from a team of software developers and DevOps engineers to deploy it to production.

We want to develop new algorithms to redefine the industry expectations for quality vs. quantity compromise. We train ML models empowered by over 1900 curators to meet both the quality and the scale requirements. ML models complement and learn from continuous curation and scale our solutions to different regions, languages, and medical specialties.
