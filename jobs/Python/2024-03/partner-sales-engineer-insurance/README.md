### About the role:

Samsara has several emerging Channel programs that have the potential to drive significant growth for the company. Some of these include our Insurance Partners, Resale Partners, Referral Partners, and Technology Integration Partners.

As a Partnership Sales Engineer, you will be working closely with our Partner Account managers and be responsible for leading technology conversations with existing and potential Insurance Partners and customers.
