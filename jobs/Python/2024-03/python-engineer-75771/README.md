# [Python Engineer](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/python-engineer-75771)  
### Canonical  
####  

This is a general track role, hiring for every team at Canonical who works in Python, across all levels of seniority. Apply here if you believe you are already an outstanding Python engineer.

Canonical works across the entire open source spectrum. Canonical Ubuntu is well-known as a developer favourite and enterprise-friendly Linux. Our web services and system utilities are often written in Python, which we choose where collaboration with other teams, ecosystems and communities is more important than raw performance.

We hire Python Developers with a passion for open-source software, innovation, and cutting-edge technologies. We also look for colleagues who understand that a great product is more than code – it is ready for the unexpected, it is well documented, it is comprehensively tested, it is tastefully presented in its CLI or GUI. At Canonical, you will have the opportunity to make significant contributions through high-quality, idiomatic Python code.

Your team will own a product that may comprise several codebases. These may be intended to run on servers, or on Kubernetes, or on the desktop, or as web services for Ubuntu clients. They may be utilities or frameworks or tools, or part of our production process.

Additionally, this role will give you the opportunity to engage with the broader open-source community. We're looking for individuals who can help build a thriving community, contribute to a broad range of technologies, and ensure seamless software operations at scale.
