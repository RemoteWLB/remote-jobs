### Canva  
#### `🌎 Australia`  

### Job Description

 **Join the team redefining how the world experiences design.**

Hey, hello, hiya, g'day, mabuhay, kia ora, 你好, hallo, vítejte!

Thanks for stopping by. We know job hunting can be a little time consuming and you're probably keen to find out what's on offer, so we'll get straight to the point.

### Where and how you can work

Our flagship campus is in Sydney. We also have a campus in Melbourne and co-working spaces in Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide. But you have choice in where and how you work. That means if you want to do your thing in the office (if you're near one), at home or a bit of both, it's up to you.

### What you’d be doing in this role

As Canva scales change continues to be part of our DNA. But we like to think that's all part of the fun. So this will give you the flavour of the type of things you'll be working on when you start, but this will likely evolve.

### At the moment, this role is focused on:

  * Forming ideas and acting as a key strategic partner to Growth Marketing teams, helping to define our marketing calendar and opportunities to drive further growth for Canva.
  * Closely coordinating with collaborators across Canva to shape analysis and recommendations. Nobody tells you what to do; you identify the opportunities and proactively rally people around the solutions.
  * Managing project intake, pipeline, prioritise, and manage staffing against key initiatives.
  * Coaching a team of data scientists you'll act as a driver of data strategy in this group and will coordinate closely with the Growth Marketing leadership team.
  * Collaborating with senior leadership and taking the initiative to keep things moving - identifying the opportunities where data can make the largest impact and see it through.
  * Reporting on the performance of our marketing metrics at a campaign or channel level but also zooming out to see the big picture. Building and maintaining dashboards for our growth marketing teams, and make them look really good - you don’t need to be a designer or have any design talent, you just need to want to build cool things.
  * Suggesting and running interesting experiments that will move our metrics.

### You're probably a match if:

  * You have demonstrable experience leading data specialists, defining team strategy and data roadmaps.
  * Communication is your superpower. You love creating alignment and asking the right questions to understand a problem.
  * You have knowledge of attribution methodologies, marketing mix modelling and incrementality of marketing campaigns is required.
  * You have experience with understanding marketing efficiency and building dashboards that effectively communicate results and outcomes.
  * You are competent with SQL; experience with data warehouses such as Snowflake, Redshift, or BigQuery is a plus!
  * You know how to wrangle and analyze data using Python or R.

### About the team

This role is part of the Global Marketing Research & Data team. We are a team of Researchers, Analytic Engineers and Data Scientists who exist to deliver a high quality understanding of our markets, competitors, marketing and users. We deliver unrivalled insight into the business to ensure that we are making the right decisions at the right time.

The team is smart, fun and excited to solve the most complex questions our 400+ marketing team throw at us. We thrive in ambiguity and love nothing more than a problem and the autonomy to solve it.

### What's in it for you?

Achieving our crazy big goals motivates us to work hard - and we do - but you'll experience lots of moments of magic, connectivity and fun woven throughout life at Canva, too. We also offer a stack of benefits to set you up for every success in and outside of work.

### Here's a taste of what's on offer:

  * Equity packages - we want our success to be yours too
  * Inclusive parental leave policy that supports all parents & carers
  * An annual Vibe & Thrive allowance to support your wellbeing, social connection, office setup & more
  * Flexible leave options that empower you to be a force for good, take time to recharge and supports you personally
