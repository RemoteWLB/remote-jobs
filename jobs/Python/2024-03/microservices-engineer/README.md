# [Microservices Engineer](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/microservices-engineer)  
### Canonical  
####  

This is a general selection track for teams that focus on back-end REST API microservices engineering in Go and Python. It covers all levels of seniority. Apply here if you are already an outstanding engineer with crisp and well-articulated views on APIs, microservice design, engineering processes and DevOps.

Our services need to scale to handle millions of Ubuntu clients, and collaboration across thousands of community members. They are also central to the health of critical infrastructure across the globe. As Ubuntu has been embraced by mainstream enterprise computing through the adoption of cloud and developer-centric tech strategy, the quality of these services has become more important to customers and users.

While Ubuntu has been enormously successful and in many senses leads the industry, we think we can substantially improve our practices, quality and performance in the web services domain. We are growing our teams, and in doing so we aim to level up our insights on scalability, performance, resilience and DevOps practices.

### Key areas of interest for us are:

  * API design, documentation, and governance
  * Database performance design considerations and skills
