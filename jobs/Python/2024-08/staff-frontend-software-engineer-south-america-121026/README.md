**About the Role:**

We are looking for a Staff Frontend Software Engineer (Full-Time Contractor) based in South America to join us on our mission to help people learn! This is a great opportunity to work with an amazing team and drive the technology of learning products and platforms. We operate in a highly collaborative environment with Product and Design to build experiences that matter to our customers.

If you love your customers as much as we do, we'd love to hear from you.

We use big data and machine learning, taking into account hundreds of variables, including Learner and Expert attributes, adaptive diagnostic assessments, and data from past learning experiences.

You will architect scalable software solutions, understand and implement best practices, and create technology that is highly performant and extensible.

The Staff Front End Engineer will assume a dual role as a technical leader and a visionary for our highly complex and high performant systems. In this capacity, they will not only provide technical guidance and mentorship to the team but also play a pivotal role in shaping and driving the overarching vision of our system, aimed at enhancing the experience for our tutors and optimizing our tutor-supply chain.

This position is a full-time remote opportunity. (We've been remote friendly for years, and that isn't going away).
