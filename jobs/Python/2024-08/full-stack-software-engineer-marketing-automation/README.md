#### `💰 $174,000/yr - $235,000/yr` `🌎 Remote`  

### **Your new team**

We help renters find their new home by connecting them with top property managers at apartments they will love. To do this, our customers use Rentable’s suite of tools to reach the perfect renter for their pad. We utilize Ruby on Rails, React.js, a plethora of AWS services and whatever the best tool is to help renters locate the apartment they want to call home. We believe a team that trusts each other, seeks to achieve mastery and reduces complexity creates an inclusive culture where all members thrive.

The Google Business Pro Team is a highly technical team with the mission to change the apartment rental industry. Our team is responsible for creating the tools our customers use every day to advertise and support their properties. Our team focuses on the Google Business Pro product, which helps property managers update and curate content for their Google and Social profiles. We utilize Generative AI to create unique, factual content for our customers to use to reach interested renters. We work directly with design, sales, and customer success to identify, prioritize and solve the most complex issues our customers have marketing their properties.

We’re a 100% remote team of 90+ spread across the U.S. from coast to coast. While we enjoy the flexibility of remote work, we get the entire department together 3 times a year to have fun and work hard in person.

While we’ve raised $30MM+ to date from some of the world’s best investors, we’re profitable with a strong balance sheet and an indefinite runway. We pride ourselves on achieving rapid growth without having to incinerate capital.
