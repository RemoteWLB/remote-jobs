At Vanta, our mission is to secure the internet and protect consumer data. We believe that security should be monitored and verified continuously, and we empower companies to practice better security and prove it with ease. Vanta has a kind and talented team, and while some have prior security experience, many have been successful at Vanta without it.

Vantaâ€™s product monitors the security posture for thousands of companies, pulling tens of millions of API calls of data per day, pushing information from hundreds of thousands of laptop agents, and running tests against that data continuously to identify potential security threats. Our frontend infrastructure and tooling need to stay ahead of exponential growth in our customer base. As a Senior Software Engineer at Vanta, youâ€™ll be responsible for setting technical direction to provide a strong foundation for our frontend stack and enable our infrastructure to scale with our business. You will also drive complex projects across our technical stack and mentor our talented engineering team. Your past experience will be leveraged to enable and accelerate Vantaâ€™s growth.

Our business has found incredible product-market fit and has monetized effectively since the day we signed our first customer. Weâ€™re growing at a blistering pace, which presents career-defining opportunities for engineers to accelerate their growth and to contribute to a rapidly-scaling company.

 **About Vanta**

We started in 2018, in the wake of several high-profile data breaches. Online security was only becoming more important, but we knew firsthand how hard it could be for fast-growing companies to invest the time and manpower it takes to build a solid security foundation. Vanta was inspired by a vision to restore trust in internet businesses by enabling companies to improve and prove their security.From our early days automating security monitoring for compliance standards like SOC 2, HIPAA and ISO 27001 to creating the world's leading Trust Management Platform, our vision remains unchanged.

Now more than ever, making security continuousâ€”not just a point-in-time checkâ€” is essential. Thousands of companies rely on Vanta to build, maintain and demonstrate their trustâ€” all in a way that's real-time and transparent.
