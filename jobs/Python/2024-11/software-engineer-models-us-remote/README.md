# [Software Engineer, Models - US (Remote)](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/software-engineer-models-us-remote)  
### Wandb  
#### `üåé remote,San Francisco, California`  

## Description

At Weights & Biases, our mission is to build the best tools for AI developers. We founded our company on the insight that while there were excellent tools for developers to build better code, there were no similarly great tools to help ML practitioners build better models. Starting with our first experiment tracking product, we have since expanded our solution into a comprehensive AI developer platform for organizations focused on building their own deep learning models and generative AI applications.

  

Weights & Biases is a Series C company with $250M in funding and over 200 employees. We proudly serve over 1,000 customers and more than 30 foundation model builders including customers such as OpenAI, NVIDIA, Microsoft, and Toyota.

  

This product-focused Software Engineer will work on our Models team. Thousands of Machine Learning Engineers use our product daily to monitor and understand their ML training runs. To learn more about what you‚Äôll be working on, see an example workspace or try our tutorial (the collaboration notebook lets you try it out with no ML experience necessary to run) - we are proud of how simple the app is to get started using.

  

Our Models team primarily work on features that enhance and centralize the machine learning development workflow for our users. Engineers in this role will be directly working with customers and other engineering teams to build products and customer experiences that will continue to enable the acceleration of machine learning model development.
