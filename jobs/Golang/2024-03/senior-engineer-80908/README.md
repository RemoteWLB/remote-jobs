### Canonical  
####  

This is a general track for Senior Engineer or above in any team at Canonical. After the first round of interviews we will establish which teams might be an excellent fit, and progress your application with them.

Canonical delivers open source to the world across every class of compute. Canonical Ubuntu is the world’s favourite Linux for cloud, desktop and IoT. Our engineering teams work on operating systems, programming languages, applications, devices, infrastructure and services. We work in Golang, Python, C, C++, and Rust for system services, and use React and Flutter on the front end.

In our levelling framework, a Senior Engineer is not only an outstanding software architect and coder, they also demonstrate the leadership qualities needed to rally a team to ship outstanding products. A Senior Engineer partners with an Engineering Manager, who is also code-capable, and together they take responsibility for team outcomes. We hire based on academic results and proven product execution, and we select those with a passion for open-source software, innovation, and cutting-edge technology. In this role, you will make a significant contribution in Canonical's portfolio through high-quality code, technical leadership, team motivation and direction, exceptional design, and crisp documentation.

As a Senior Engineer you'll drive the architecture, design and evolution of high-impact open source. Our teams work at every level of the stack. From the kernel and system software at the core of Ubuntu through to major language runtimes and the bleeding-edge of cloud automation and distributed systems, you'll have the opportunity to work on complex but highly rewarding projects. Our teams also build the services which deliver Ubuntu to the world, on cloud, devices, servers and PCs.

Additionally, this role will give you the opportunity to engage with the broader open-source community. We're looking for individuals who can help build a thriving community, contribute to a broad range of technologies, and ensure seamless software operations at scale.
