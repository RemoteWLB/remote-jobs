# [Distributed Systems Engineer (L5) - Cloud Engineering](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/distributed-systems-engineer-l5-cloud-engineering-38810)  
### Netflix  
#### `💰 820000.0` `🌎 United States`  

Netflix is one of the world's leading streaming entertainment services with over 260 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, films and games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can play, pause and resume watching as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.

Netflix has been on the leading edge of the cloud since beginning the migration to AWS 15 years ago and runs one of the largest Cloud footprints around. The Cloud Engineering organization exists to manage that massive scale, constantly innovating to increase fleet-wide agility, efficiency, and reliability of the Netflix cloud infrastructure, while solving scale problems that we are the first to ever hit. We build, operate, and maintain Compute, Network and Storage services so that developers at Netflix can rely on foundational building blocks when entertaining hundreds of millions of customers around the world. Join us as we push the boundaries of performance and resilience, empowering developers to create groundbreaking applications on a reliable platform.

We are looking to add new stunning colleagues to the teams outlined below.

### Team Spotlights

### Infra API

InfraAPI is Netflix's in-house IaaC solution - a resource federation platform built upon Kubernetes. We enable infra providers like compute, storage or networking to create end developer "resources" (aka primitives / abstractions) using a simple declarative language. This makes it possible to quickly ship experiences continuously raising the level of abstraction without needing to manually integrate with a number of delivery /mgmt platforms.

### Compute Runtime

Every engineer at Netflix works under the “build it, run it” model and our job is to make it safe, easy, and performant for them to run what they build. We own the host-level foundation for Netflix’s server fleet: the customized base operating system and core services that enable the secure and efficient operation of hosts across Netflix. We build core services that enable the provisioning and operation of large server fleets and own the data plane of our centrally managed container platform, Titus.

### Must-have skills

  * 7+ years of professional Software Engineering experience, preferably with recent technical leadership
  * Recent and proficient experience with Java, C++, Go, Python, or similar
  * Experience building operating highly reliable distributed systems in a cloud environment
  * Passion for technology, pragmatic thinking, ability to jump into an ambiguous area and break down complex problems

### What you'll be doing

  * Building and operating Services, APIs, and Tooling for a variety of use-cases
  * Balancing bias to action with the ability to make well-informed bets
  * Engaging directly with end engineering users to understand their needs and improve their experience
  * Understanding and solving business needs at scale with high-quality solutions
  * Leaning into proactiveness and effective communication in pursuit of cross-functional alignment

### Success criteria

  * You thrive in ambiguity; complex and fuzzy requirements are more common than clearly defined customer expectations
  * You take incremental steps toward solving big problems; test and learn approaches work better than heads down development
  * You are independent and self driven; progress is often self-directed by teams individuals 
  * You’ve read about Netflix’s culture and think you would thrive here

Here are a few recent talks and posts from members of the team to highlight the work we do:

Does this sound interesting? Or does this sound interesting-but-intimidating? Please don’t self-select out, let’s figure it out together. We’d love to talk to you!
