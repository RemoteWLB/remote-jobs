This is our general process for Golang engineers of all levels of seniority, for all relevant teams at Canonical. Apply here if you are an exceptional software engineer who prefers to work in Go. After the first round of interviews we’ll find the best fit product team at Canonical for you to progress your application based on your personal interests.

Canonical prefers Golang for software where performance and security are primary considerations. We also have substantial projects in Python, C, C++ and are starting to invest in Rust. For front-end development we prefer React and Flutter.

Golang is an essential language for our engineering teams, who build the systems that deliver Ubuntu to the world. From our software distribution systems, to those which build and test every possible kind of open source on every architecture, from our systems management tools to our distributed systems operations RD, we count on Golang for its tasteful concurrency and developer ecosystem. Juju, Livepatch, LXD, MAAS, Microk8s, Snapd, Ubuntu Core, Ubuntu Pro, and many more Canonical offerings include Golang components.

We also want to ensure that Ubuntu is the very best platform for Golang development, offering easy access to the widest range of tooling and capabilities that support cutting edge open source and enterprise development.

Join us in our mission to deliver innovative open-source solutions to individuals and enterprises around the world. We expect the highest engineering standards and strong motivation to get things done well in a fully remote and distributed environment.
