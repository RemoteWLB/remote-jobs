OctoAI is a leading startup in the fast-paced generative AI market. Our mission is to empower businesses to build differentiated applications that delight customers with the latest generative AI features.

Our platform, OctoAI, delivers generative AI infrastructure to run, tune, and scale models that power AI applications. OctoAI makes models work for you by providing developers easy access to efficient AI infrastructure so they can run the models they choose, tune them for their specific use case, and scale from dev to production seamlessly. With the fastest foundation models on the market (including Llama-2, Stable Diffusion, and SDXL), integrated customization solutions, and world-class ML systems under the hood, developers can focus on building apps that wow their customers without becoming AI infrastructure experts.

Our team consists of experts in cloud services, infrastructure, machine learning systems, hardware, and compilers as well as an accomplished go-to-market team with diverse backgrounds.
