### Tackle  
#### `ðŸŒŽ remote,USA`  

## Description

Tackle is the leading solution built to help software companies generate revenue through a data-driven Cloud go-to-market (Cloud GTM). Our Platform and our team come together to help our customers identify the right buyers, grow cloud co-sell relationships, and transact efficiently at scale through AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft.

  

Tackle works with more than 500 software companies including Auth0, CrowdStrike, HashiCorp, Lacework, New Relic, Snyk, VMware, and many more at every stageâ€”from companies scaling their go-to-market to the largest software companies in the world. We are venture backed by three of the world's top SaaS investorsâ€”a16z, Bessemer Venture Partners, and Coatueâ€”to execute on our mission to positively transform the way that software is sold.

  

As a Salesforce Engineer at Tackle, you will be a part of a well-funded, fully remote, growth-stage company helping shape the way that software is bought and sold in the Cloud Marketplaces (AWS, GCP, Azure and Red Hat). We are built on the foundation that a 100% remote team can be the healthiest, happiest and most productive; from the beginning we have been intentionally building a phenomenal culture that ensures everyone feels connected no matter where they are working from. Our platform has enabled some of the software industryâ€™s most successful names to get listed, start selling, and scale their Cloud Marketplace operations.

  

Tackleâ€™s Engineering team is growing, and we are looking for talented engineers to craft solid and reliable software at a sustainable pace. We balance consistent innovation and improvement of existing products with new and exciting greenfield projects. You will work in an exciting, positive environment surrounded by kind, talented, creative people. Tacklers have a bias to action, and we act without ego; in all interactions we know it is critical to respect, value and support each other. We succeed and fail as a team, with a mindset of pursuing success instead of avoiding failure. Wellness is a critical pillar of the company and we live this value in a variety of ways, with empathetic servant leadership at every level and flexible working hours to ensure a healthy work-life harmony.

  

You will have the opportunity to interface with a number of teams across our Platform, Co-Sell, Channel and Marketplace Selling development teams. Expect to grow and evolve as an engineer by building and executing on a detailed growth plan tailored to your interests and aspirations.
