 **The Role**

  

Are you passionate about working as part of a software engineering team with the talent, energy, and financial backing to deliver killer, industry-changing cloud-based applications built on a content platform? Do you live for the challenges of a dynamic, rapidly growing startup that cranks out major releases every four months?

  

If so, we may have the job for you. We are looking for an experienced and driven engineer for the Automation Platform team for the Veeva Vault Platform team. This is a hands-on role where you will be working alongside a team of highly talented engineers who are helping us build a solid automation platform that can operate at scale and be used/extended by application teams with ease/autonomy (self-service model).

  

We have four building blocks for the platform.

  

a. **Tools:** e.g. Web applications to enhance Quality Operations productivity using JAVA/JavaScript/REACT/Postgres/AWS

b. **Reporting:** Generate innovative analytics reports of varying details suiting to different personas using data from various data sources such as PostGRESQL, AWS Elastic or Open Search, route it to DataBricks, and build powerful BI dashboards in Sigma

c. **Infrastructure:** (e.g. Test Automation Pipelines in Jenkins using Groovy/Python/Shell scripting)

d. **Framework:** (Application agnostic framework utilities built using TestNG, Cucumber, RESTAssured e.g. Cross browser support in Automation pipelines using AMIs/Lambda Test integration)

  

In this role, you will be exposed to and trained in the basics of all the building blocks, and you will be expected to be a master of a minimum of two of those while you grow more into the role.

  

If that's not exciting enough, we run over 100K tests in our CI/CD pipeline everyday, dynamically spin up 100s of servers in the cloud to power automation runs and have some pretty sophisticated tooling in place to consume the results.
