## Description

At Olo we develop an online food ordering platform used by many of the country's largest restaurant chains, reaching millions of consumers. Chances are if you've ordered directly from a restaurant brand's app or website, we've made that happen.

  

As part of the Core Ordering Features team, you will play a significant and visible role in helping us scale one of the most advanced food ordering platforms in the market. You will develop, scale, and monitor solutions, improvements, and services across our ordering platform, which supports hundreds of integrations internal and external to Olo. The team also develops new features and extends functionality, both within our Ordering API and across custom front end integrations with partners.

  

We aim to collaborate well. We encourage new ideas and experimentation. No part of the codebase is off-limits. We take pride in a neat codebase with automated tests and continuous integration and encourage constant refactoring. You'll work with a passionate team dedicated to delivering amazing products using modern technologies.

  

You will report to an Engineering Manager, and can work remotely from anywhere in the U.S. or at Olo’s headquarters in NYC.

 **We encourage you to apply!**

  

 **We value diversity.** At Olo, we know a diverse and inclusive team makes our workplace better. Don't meet every single qualification in the job description? Market data shows that women and people of color are less likely to apply to jobs unless they meet every single qualification.
