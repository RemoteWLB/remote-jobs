## Description

At Bodo, we are redefining whatâ€™s possible with Python for analytics, data engineering, and AI. Weâ€™ve developed the worldâ€™s first auto-parallelizing Python compiler, delivering HPC-level performance and efficiency for large-scale data processing. Now, we are building upon this foundational software and applying it directly to analytics and AI, empowering organizations of all sizes to new levels of efficiency, speed, and accuracy that could never before be met.

  

Our compiler technology has already empowered some of the worldâ€™s most data-driven companies to solve their data challenges with unprecedented speed and scalability. Backed by leaders like Dell Technologies, Snowflake, and AMD, and adopted by Fortune 10 customers, we are just beginning to unlock the true potential of data platforms.

  

Thatâ€™s why we call it Transformative Python.

  

Weâ€™re looking for talented engineers with a passion for compilers, HPC, and AI to join us on this exciting journey to reshape the future of data analytics.

  

Bodo is seeking a software engineer with a passion for software development to help with our mission of removing technical barriers to data. You will work at the intersection of Python, data analytics, and AI to create the **PyDough Project** , which leverages object relationships to build an analytics interface that is more scalable to complex business questions and a better target for LLM generation.

  

As a Software Engineer, you will directly influence the direction of the project by working to ensure PyDough is highly efficient, building a best-in-class user experience, including AI integration, and ultimately ensuring PyDough is general enough to be used with a variety of data sources. In this role, you can help build a future where data analytics is accessible to people of all backgrounds.
