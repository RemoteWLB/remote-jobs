**About Us:**

Fieldguide is building a new standard of trust for global commerce and capital markets by automating and streamlining the work of assurance and audit professionals, particularly in cybersecurity, privacy, and financial audit.

Weâ€™re based in San Francisco, CA, but built as a remote-first company that enables you to do your best work from anywhere. We're backed by top investors including Bessemer Venture Partners, 8VC, Y Combinator, Floodgate, Elad Gil, Justin Kan, Qasar Younis, Eric Ries, and more.

We value diversity â€” in backgrounds and experiences. We need people from all backgrounds and walks of life to help build the future of audit and advisory. Fieldguideâ€™s team is inclusive, driven, humble, and supportive. We are deliberate and self-reflective about the kind of team and culture we are building, seeking teammates who are strong in their own aptitudes and care deeply about supporting each other's growth.

As a team member, youâ€™ll have the opportunity to build out the future of business trust. We make audit practitionersâ€™ lives easier by eliminating up to 50% of their work and improving their work-life balance. If you share our values and enthusiasm for building a great culture and product, you will find a home at Fieldguide.

 **About the Role:**

We are seeking a Forward Deployed Engineer (FDE) to work closely with our customers, driving successful deployments of the Fieldguide platform and tailoring it to their unique environments.

  * Communicate customer insights to Product and Engineering teams, influencing the roadmap and enhancing the platformâ€™s adaptability.

  * Conduct technical training for customer teams, equipping them to maximize the platformâ€™s value in their workflows.

  * Travel for onsite engagements (5-10%) to provide direct support during key implementation phases.

 **About You:**

  * 3+ years in a technical role, ideally within software deployment, customer success engineering, or field engineering. Experience with enterprise or SaaS software is beneficial.

  * Hands-on experience in software engineering, systems integration, or related fields, with proficiency in modern programming languages (e.g., Python, TypeScript) and cloud technologies. Familiarity with AI and machine learning models such as GPT is a plus.

  * Strong understanding of systems integration and data migration processes, with experience in ensuring seamless interoperability with client systems and tools.

  * Proven experience working in a customer-facing role, with the ability to translate complex technical concepts for a range of stakeholders, both technical and non-technical.
