## Description

Company Description

Swiftly is on a mission to help cities move more efficiently. We are the leading transit data platform for agencies to share real-time passenger information, manage day-to-day operations, and improve service performance. Today, over 180 transit agencies in 11 countries â€“ including LA Metro, MARTA, SEPTA, and MBTA â€“ rely on Swiftly to improve on-time performance by up to 40% and increase passenger information accuracy by up to 50%. The result is better service reliability, increased ridership, and more efficient transit operations.

  

 **Engineering at Swiftly**

Engineering at Swiftly is not only about writing code â€“ we believe in creating empowered product teams that work together to conceptualize new features and bring them to life. Each team aims to strike a balance between delivering incremental improvements, creating prototypes to test new ideas and mitigate risks, and building scalable software using industry best practices. Weâ€™re guided by a mission to positively impact transit riders, and we embrace humility and intentionality in how we make technical decisions so that we best meet our customersâ€™ needs.

  

 _Even though Swiftly's HQ office is located in San Francisco, CA, we are open to candidates in most locations across the U.S. as well as Ontario and British Columbia, Canada, who are open to traveling at least once a quarter. At this time, we are unable to provide Visa sponsorship._

  

 **About the Role**

You will work on improving the software platform underpinning Swiftlyâ€™s products. Your work will help us improve how we deploy the platform that ingests real-time transit data (especially push feeds from IoT devices), meet a 99.9% uptime SLA, and expand to more cities around the globe. Your work will ensure the reliability and availability of all Swiftly products. You will help solve real problems for transit agencies, resulting in improved transit service. We encourage you to apply if you meet half or more of the requirements and are excited to learn about the rest. Above all else, we value candidates who have a positive attitude and the aptitude to learn the requisite skills. We know the tech landscape is ever-changing and strongly supports individual growth. If this is exciting to you, we'd love to talk to you.
