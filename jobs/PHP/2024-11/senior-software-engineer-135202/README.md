## Description

At Bodo, we are redefining whatâ€™s possible with Python for analytics, data engineering, and AI. Weâ€™ve developed the worldâ€™s first auto-parallelizing Python compiler, delivering HPC-level performance and efficiency for large-scale data processing. Now, we are building upon this foundational software and applying it directly to analytics and AI, empowering organizations of all sizes to new levels of efficiency, speed, and accuracy that could never before be met.

  

Our compiler technology has already empowered some of the worldâ€™s most data-driven companies to solve their data challenges with unprecedented speed and scalability. Backed by leaders like Dell Technologies, Snowflake, and AMD, and adopted by Fortune 10 customers, we are just beginning to unlock the true potential of data platforms.

  

Thatâ€™s why we call it Transformative Python.

  

Weâ€™re looking for talented engineers with a passion for compilers, HPC, and AI to join us on this exciting journey to reshape the future of data analytics.

  

We are seeking a talented and experienced Senior Software Engineer to join our team as the Technical Lead. The ideal candidate will have experience designing, developing, and maintaining data pipelines combining data infrastructure and AI training infrastructure, to create an end-to-end product.
