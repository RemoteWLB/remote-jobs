# [Senior Software Engineer - AI Agents](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/senior-software-engineer-ai-agents)  
### Datafold  
#### `ðŸŒŽ USA`  

Datafold is a fast-growing, Series A startup at the forefront of data quality and observabilityâ€”think Datadog for data engineers. Backed by top-tier investors including YC, Amplify, and NEA, we're redefining how companies like Disney, FanDuel, and Perplexity maintain quality across the entire data lifecycle. Although headquartered in the US, weâ€™re a fully remote team with employees across the US and EU.  
  
Weâ€™re looking for an experienced backend (or full-stack) engineer to help build and scale the Datafold Migration Agent (DMA)â€”an AI-powered tool thatâ€™s changing the game in data migration. Combining large language models with our unique data diffing technology, DMA automates SQL dialect translation and data reconciliation, slashing migration timelines by 5-10x and eliminating the need for manual work and costly consultants.

## About the Role

  * Drive the development of DMA, shaping both the technical and architectural foundation for a product that combines AI and data engineering to solve complex migration challenges.

  * Design, develop, and maintain backend systems focused on AI-driven SQL translation and cross-database data comparison.

  * Collaborate with early customers to refine features and iterate toward product-market fit.

  * Make strategic technical decisions to ensure DMA is scalable, robust, and optimized for high-performance data migration.

  * Take ownership of projects end-to-end, troubleshooting and resolving complex challenges in real time to deliver high-quality, impactful results.

## About You

  *  **Experience** : 5+ years as a software engineer with a strong backend focus.

  *  **Tech Stack** : Proficiency in Python is required; experience building with LLMs and/or JavaScript/TypeScript is a plus.

  *  **Ownership** : Proven ability to manage projects end-to-end, from design through deployment.

  *  **Startup Mindset** : Thoughtful about balancing speed, quality, and business impact.

If building a high-impact, innovative product at the intersection of AI and data engineering sounds exciting, weâ€™d love to hear from you.
