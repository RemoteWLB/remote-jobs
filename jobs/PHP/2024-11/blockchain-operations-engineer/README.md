## Description

 **About the Company**

  

Hi, we're Ondo Finance. Our mission is to provide institutional-grade, blockchain-enabled investment products and services. We have both a technology arm that develops decentralized finance technology, and an asset management arm that creates and manages tokenized funds. We were the first company to tokenize exposure to US Treasuries, and have since expanded into several other assets. We are also focused on incubating protocols that can support both tokenized real-world assets and traditional crypto.

  

Founded by folks from Goldman Sachs Digital Assets Team, weâ€™re backed by some of the best investors in the world including Founders Fund, Coinbase Ventures, Pantera Capital, Tiger Global, and more. We are currently the leaders in the space in terms of AUM and are well capitalized to continue growing the firm. We're fully remote, with team members across the U.S.

  

 **About the Role**

  

We're looking for a highly motivated individual to join our team as a Blockchain Operations Engineer. In this role, you will streamline engineering workflows through automation and system management, ensuring the seamless operation of our blockchain infrastructure. You will be working on exciting, cutting-edge technologies, contributing to our token management, monitoring systems, and integrations, all while prioritizing security and operational efficiency. We value continuous improvement and provide a supportive environment where you can grow your skills and make a real impact.

  

 **Responsibilities**

  

â€¢Multisig Management: Manage and maintain secure, compliant, and efficient multisig setups.

â€¢Token Management: Build and maintain systems to track and manage our on-chain tokens. Perform analysis and reporting on the markets where our tokens are traded and lent.

â€¢Automations: Build and maintain complex automation systems for Ondoâ€™s on chain and off chain operations.

â€¢Internal & External Dashboard Management: Develop and maintain internal observability tools and ensure accurate data is displayed on external tools like block explorers and analytics platforms.

â€¢Monitoring & Alerting Systems: Design and maintain internal monitoring systems for our blockchain products to ensure smooth and reliable operation.

â€¢System Integrations: Develop and maintain reliable software integrations for both internal teams and external stakeholders.

â€¢Oracle Management: Build systems for managing and maintaining both internal and external blockchain oracles.

  

 **Requirements**

  

â€¢Based in PT, MT, CT, or ET time zones.

â€¢Excellent technical and non-technical communication skills, verbal and written.

â€¢At least 6 months of professional software engineering experience, ideally in the blockchain or crypto space.

â€¢CS or related degree preferred but not required for the right candidate.

â€¢Familiar with blockchain application layers, particularly fungible token standards like ERC20 and SPL.

â€¢Hands-on experience with decentralized finance protocols and exchanges, ideally in a professional setting.

â€¢Interest in cybersecurity, especially regarding large crypto-related hacks, and a commitment to ensuring operational security.

â€¢Eager to take on operational tasks to support the engineering team and contribute to overall team success, regardless of the complexity of the work.

  

 **Preferred Skills**

  

â€¢Experience with multisignature and/or Multi-party computation wallets schemes in a professional setting is a plus.

â€¢Familiarity with EVM, Solana, SUI, Aptos, or Cosmos ecosystems. Understanding the fundamentals of at least one of these ecosystems is essential.

â€¢Ability to design and refine processes for technical and non-technical teams.

  

 **What we offer:**

  

â€¢Competitive compensation including salary, future token rights, and/or equity (according to your preferences) â€” we're well-funded and believe that great talent deserves great compensation.

â€¢Full benefits (medical, vision, and dental) and flexible vacation policy (PTO).

â€¢Small remote-first team across many countries â€” you'll be an early team member helping shape our vision, culture, and design practices.

â€¢A+ colleagues â€” our team includes alumni from: Goldman Sachs, Blackrock, Two Sigma, Bridgewater, SpaceX, AWS, Meta, Google, McKinsey, Circle, Uniswap.

â€¢Best-in-class investors â€” we are proud to be backed by leading crypto experts and VCs, including Pantera Capital, Founders Fund and Coinbase Ventures.
