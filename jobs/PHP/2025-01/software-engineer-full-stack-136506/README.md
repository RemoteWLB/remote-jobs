## Description

About Mashgin

At Mashgin, we have developed a successful and innovative point-of-sale experience that uses computer vision and AI to make checkout nearly instantaneous. Our mission is to eliminate checkout lines so people can get back to their lives.

  

Our kiosks are currently serving customers in thousands of locations around the world, from major sports stadiums to convenience stores, from college campuses to corporate cafeterias. We are a series B startup with 10 years of progress, and weâ€™re already profitable. And weâ€™re just getting started.

  

We value autonomy of work, a relentless obsession with customer experience (both our customers and their end-customers), and a culture of respect and fun.

  

  

Position Summary

Weâ€™re looking for a full-stack developer to help us build the software that runs our kiosks and powers the extensive infrastructure behind them. In addition to building more traditional web stacks, youâ€™ll work on code that interfaces with our hardware and visual components, making sure kiosks are extra reliable and the user experience amazing. This is not a specialized position -- we believe in end-to-end ownership of projects, so youâ€™ll be involved throughout the entire product lifecycle, from idea generation, design, and prototyping to execution, and shipping while contributing to many different parts of the codebase in multiple languages.

  

This is a remote, contract position for individuals who are based in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. Mashgin is headquartered in Palo Alto, CA.
