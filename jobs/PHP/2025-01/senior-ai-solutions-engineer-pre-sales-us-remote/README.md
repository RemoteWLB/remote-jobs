## Description

At Weights & Biases, our mission is to build the best tools for AI developers. We founded our company on the insight that while there were excellent tools for developers to build better code, there were no similarly great tools to help ML practitioners build better models. Starting with our first experiment tracking product, we have since expanded our solution into a comprehensive AI developer platform for organizations focused on building their own deep learning models and generative AI applications.

  

Weights & Biases is a Series C company with $250M in funding and over 200 employees. We proudly serve over 1,000 customers and more than 30 foundation model builders including customers such as OpenAI, NVIDIA, Microsoft, and Toyota.

  

We're hiring an AI Solutions Engineer to help our customers solve difficult, real-world problems and engage in ground-breaking research by using our developer tools in their machine learning pipelines.

This specific role will be focusing more on Weights & Biases‚Äô engagement with prospective customers who are evaluating Weights & Biases for their use case. You'll have the opportunity to work with ML teams across multiple industries to uncover their ML needs, improve their ML workflow, explore how Weights & Biases fits into their environment, collaborate on projects, and educate them on the best practices of our product. Specifically, the person in this role will be responsible for assessing the prospective customer‚Äôs technical requirement and specification, demonstrate Weights & Biases' functionality that highlights those capabilities, designing and executing proof of values (as needed), and securing a technical success in the evaluation process.

  

Solutions Engineers on our Field Engineering team are critical to the success of our customers at Weights & Biases. You'll partner with Sales, Support, Product, and Engineering teams to own the technical success of the pre-sales evaluation of Weights & Biases for our prospective customers, serving as the primary knowledge owner and face to our customers.
