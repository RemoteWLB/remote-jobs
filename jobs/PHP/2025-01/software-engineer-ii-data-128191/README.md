## Description

 **About the Position**

FiscalNote seeks an experienced Software Engineer to join our Data Engineering team. You will help scale and improve our data processing capabilities by designing, building, and supporting services that handle one of the largest collections of policy and policymaker data, across many countries, levels of government, and commercial sectors, including large unstructured content in the form of video, audio, and text. Your role involves creating reliable systems that can provide this data in a timely and accurate way at scale, ultimately making it accessible and actionable. You will design systems that integrate and work closely with partners in applications and data science to provide our customers with an unprecedented level of automated analysis and reporting.

  

 **About the Engineering Team**

The Data Engineering Team is responsible for the full lifecycle of open data in our Public Policy and Transcriptions products. We identify the datasets that we want to offer, then ingest, process, augment, store, and make them accessible to our clients and applications. We maintain the quality and usability of a rapidly growing collection of unstructured and structured data from frequently-brittle and obsolete external sources, mostly relating to policy and government action in the legislative and regulatory space. Our data powers multiple client-facing products and internal tools, and serves as the core foundation of FiscalNoteâ€™s success.

  

 **About You**

You take pride in ambitious projects that push your limits, and enjoy collaborating with team members to overcome technical challenges. You are committed to seeing projects through to completion and prioritizing the best decisions for the team. Along the way, youâ€™re capable of communicating what youâ€™re thinking to both technical and non-technical audiences, taking in othersâ€™ ideas as well as expressing your own. Youâ€™re comfortable around ambiguity and with a high degree of autonomy, and are excited about solving complex, open-ended problems.
