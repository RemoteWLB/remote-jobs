### None  
#### `ðŸŒŽ San Francisco`  

This role is remote, so it can be executed globally. If you prefer, you can work from our offices in New York, London and Warsaw.

##  **About ElevenLabs**

At ElevenLabs, we are pioneering voice technology with our cutting-edge research and products.

We launched in January 2023 and have since reached over 1 million users globally and have partnered with the worldâ€™s biggest names (see customer stories). We have closed our Series-B funding at 1.1B valuation earlier this year and are backed by the leading names in tech and AI (Nat Fridman, Daniel Gross, Andreessen Horowitz, Instagram co-founder Mike Krieger, Oculus VR co-founder Brendan Iribe, Deepmind & Inflection co-founder Mustafa Suleyman, and many others).

We are at an exciting phase of our growth and innovation and are looking for ambitious people to help us further push the boundaries of voice AI. This is a rare chance to be an early member of a company on the rise. If this excites you, we want to meet you!

## **Who we are**

A global team of passionate and innovative individuals united by curiosity and a shared goal: to be the first choice for AI audio solutions. Together, we are shaping a new technology and market from the ground up. We innovate quickly and take pride in getting things right, from the big picture initiatives to the details that keep us moving smoothly every day. We work with high autonomy and accountability where the best idea wins at any time and from anyone.

## **About the role**

We are hiring a developer advocate. You'll play a core part in improving our developer experience particularly developer docs and example projects â€” deeply understanding where users are getting stuck and then writing/shipping what they need. You will also help drive customer acquisition of our technical self-serve customers to drive customer acquisition (by getting to the front page of HackerNews, driving SEO traffic, and some Twitter threads). This is perfect for someone who has spent a significant amount of time writing code but also loves writing and supporting other developers. We primarily focus on driving impact online rather than in-person events for the foreseeable future.

##  **Who you are**

We're looking for exceptional individuals who combine technical excellence with ethical awareness, who are excited by hard problems and motivated by human impact. Youâ€™ll strive with us if you:

  * Are **passionate about audio AI** driven by a desire to make content universally accessible and breaking the frontiers of new tech. 

  * Are a **highly motivated and driven individual** with a strong work ethic. Our team is aware of this critical moment of audio AI evolution and is committed to going the extra mile to lead. 

  * Are **analytical, efficient, and strive on solving complex challenges** with a first principles mindset. 

  * Consistently **strive for excellence** , delivering high-quality work quickly and exceeding expectations.

  *  **Take initiative and work autonomously** from day one, prioritizing learning and contribution while leaving ego aside.

##  **What you bring**

  * Strong full-stack engineer with an eye for design

  * You can come up with a great idea for a tutorial, build a working demo, and create a high-quality blog post

  * You like to write engaging technical content

  * You will treat technical content as a product - understanding the metrics and speaking to users to decide what to build/write, and then doubling down on what works

  * (Bonus) Youâ€™ve built something already with the ElevenLabs APIs

  * (Bonus) Experience with SEO or developer advocacy

##  **What we offer**

  *  **High-velocity innovation:** Rapid experimentation, lean autonomous teams, and minimal bureaucracy.

  *  **A truly global team:** Collaboration with teammates across 30+ countries, a global customer footprint and office hubs in New York, London and Warsaw. Annual company offsite for the whole team to get together (the last one in Croatia!) 

  * **Remote first:** We prioritize your talent, not your location, with structured asynchronous workflows for maximum impact and minimal meetings.

  *  **Continuous growth** : Collaborate with AI leaders, shape your path, and contribute where you excel most.
