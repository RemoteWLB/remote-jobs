As a senior full stack AI platform engineer at Vanta, you will play a crucial role in shaping Vantaâ€™s AI offerings, improving our systems, and setting technical strategy for our end-to-end ML/AI architecture. Youâ€™ll be part of the core AI team, working alongside a multidisciplinary group of product engineers, machine learning engineers, product managers, and security and compliance experts to implement, scale, and maintain data pipelines that accelerate AI innovations. In this role, youâ€™ll build solid infrastructure foundations and high-leverage developer tools that empower Vantaâ€™s engineers to create and enhance high-quality AI products efficiently.

  * Design, build, and improve AI infrastructure and tooling to unblock product strategy

  * Make effective tradeoffs that consider business priorities, user experience, and a sustainable technical foundation

  * You are comfortable operating up and down the stack: frontend, API, backend, and database

  * You have worked at rapidly scaling startups and large companies, especially with environments that prioritize a bias for action

  * You are action-driven, willing to roll up your sleeves and engage directly with users. While you bring strong opinions, you prioritize building a platform that meets users where they are

 **About Vanta**

We started in 2018, in the wake of several high-profile data breaches. Online security was only becoming more important, but we knew firsthand how hard it could be for fast-growing companies to invest the time and manpower it takes to build a solid security foundation. Vanta was inspired by a vision to restore trust in internet businesses by enabling companies to improve and prove their security.From our early days automating security monitoring for compliance standards like SOC 2, HIPAA and ISO 27001 to creating the world's leading Trust Management Platform, our vision remains unchanged.

Now more than ever, making security continuousâ€”not just a point-in-time checkâ€” is essential. Thousands of companies rely on Vanta to build, maintain and demonstrate their trustâ€” all in a way that's real-time and transparent.
