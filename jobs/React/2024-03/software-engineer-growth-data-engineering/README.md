  * Refine our existing data marts that help the Sales and Marketing organization at Stripe forecast the future potential performance of the business, and reliably measure their ongoing attainment toward targets
  * Build data pipelines that track key GTM product metrics, and measure the impact of different GTM strategies employed by teams in the field
  * Integrate different parts of our experimentation infrastructure at Stripe, to enable full-funnel measurement and personalization of experiences spanning from Stripe.com into product
