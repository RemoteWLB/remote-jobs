# [Web Frontend Engineer - JS, CSS, React, Flutter](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/web-frontend-engineer-js-css-react-flutter)  
### Canonical  
#### `🌎 United States`  

This is a general track for applications to any team at Canonical that works with web-centric tech (JS, TypeScript, React, CSS, Flutter), across all seniority levels.

Many of Canonical’s enterprise products have web front-ends. In order to create consistency across our products and sites, we have a central team that builds an open source React toolkit and presentation layer, the Vanilla Framework. We are excited to develop this further and see if we can help more open source projects build performant and accessible interfaces that respond well to diverse layouts. We use REST APIs for communication, and we consider API design an important part of the process.

We care about accessibility in our products and take time to work with designers.

Flutter is a new front-end technology that has the potential to unify our desktop and web development. We are growing the team's exposure to Flutter and have roles on both web and Ubuntu engineering for this specialism.

We hire developers with outstanding academic results and a passion for open-source software, innovation, and cutting-edge web technologies. In these roles, you will have the opportunity to make significant contributions through high-quality, front-end and back-end code while exhibiting technical leadership, exceptional design, and intuitive user experience.
