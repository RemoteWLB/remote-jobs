###  Our future goals

Our vision is to build a product that the world has never seen before, by innovating in the home services market and offering our users a truly disruptive experience. We feel that finding a home expert should not be a laborious task but should be as easy as eating a cake (yummy!). Thus we envision to build a product that fundamentally changes the way home tasks are performed. Using this product innovation we plan to rapidly expand to several countries in the next 2 years, making Douleutaras a global player in the home services industry!

###  

### How we innovate in Douleutaras

We cannot revolutionize and disrupt the home services market without first starting a revolution ourselves – internally! We are Douleutaras, we encourage autonomy, ethos, innovation and we like to move fast!

We seek our team members to have an explosive career path and a constant boost of knowledge, and we have set up specific evolution steps to make sure we achieve it – together.

Our teams are small, empowered and autonomous. We allow teams to define the methodology desired and used. From Scrum to Kanban, as well as other practices such as test-driven methodologies and pair programming, you will be the one defining it and you will be the one guiding us towards it!

Joining Douleutaras, you will find great colleagues to assist you technically and psychologically to achieve your goals! Our environment enhances knowledge, friendliness, and excellence - even if it means spending a bit more time to achieve perfection!

We build the product together! We believe our product needs input from every source, so we encourage open expression, ideation, and participation in order to achieve a great user experience. After all, we eat our own food, we are all users of Douleutaras having a first class experience of the quality of services that we offer!

Lastly, we always give back. We encourage open source contribution and provide the time to achieve it. What comes around goes around, or else, give and it will be given to you :)

###  

### Tools we use to build...

Cutting edge technology is what we use and we do not fear experimentation if this leads to product innovation or just a great tech time in the office :) Our amazing internal monitoring systems are here to protect us by providing an isolated environment on which we can go nuts! And nuts we do go!

This is an outline of our current tech:

  * Our web app is in React and Angular
  * Our Back-end is in Python running on the Django framework
  * We use Nativescript for our mobile app
  * All our applications are Dockerized
  * Our servers work on AWS
  * We like serverless technologies as we are really greedy when it comes to computing power
  * We use databases of all sorts to suit our needs: PostgreSQL, ElasticSearch, Memcached.
  * Data Science is viciously used as it makes us stand out from the crowd! Python here my friends!

If you are curious to find out more about our tech stack, send us an email. We love wasting time and talking tech!  

###  

### About this role

As a Software Engineer (Back-end) you will be building core capabilities and services for Douleutaras and you must be passionate about software engineering and awesome product experiences. You should care deeply about writing solid code, you closely follow industry trends and the open source community, you are curious and an avid learner. You have a strong opinion about technologies and are willing to test new ideas out. You like to move fast and get code into production because you know that your work has a positive impact on the lives of end users.

You will also be in the driving seat for installing awesome infrastructure to assist the business geographical expansion plans which require more tech power and better delivery pipelines! Bring in some horsepower and cloud capacity please!!!

Our product’s backend is in pure Python and we strictly follow Python’s best practices and coding principles. We currently make full use of the Django framework in conjunction with Django’s REST framework and numerous Django applications.

We rely on PostgreSQL for our database needs, so you will need concrete knowledge of its optimizations and host configuration. Search is done through a cluster of ElasticSearch nodes and we constantly try to optimize search times. All our asynchronous tasks are performed through Celery.

Our deployment pipeline lives on Gitlab CI and functions with a hybrid of Ansible playbooks deploying to cloud instances and Docker containers. It is rock solid with zero downtime but there is always room for improvement.

Our Front End is a combination of Angular, React and TypeScript with a tight focus on writing optimized code for the best possible user experience. Implementation follows strict UX/UI principles communicated by our talented Design team. We use Gulp to automate tasks such as bundling and minifying, SASS/SCSS for our CSS and CoffeeScript where we have deemed necessary.

Our Front End code is deployed alongside the back-end code. It goes through a Gitlab CI pipeline later bundled in with the Python application’s code for delivery.

Our mobile application is built on NativeScript using Angular to share core codebase with Front End in the most efficient way and allows us to build native mobile apps for iOS and Android drastically speeding up development and release cycle. Native iOS and Android development tools are also used to build platform- and hardware-specific components. We also strictly follow human interface design guidelines to have the most intuitive and easy-to-use mobile application for our customers.

###  

### Have we not persuaded you yet? Some more points:  

  * Your opinion will be highly appreciated and valued. We only hire creative and open-minded people who are not afraid to listen to new ideas.
  * You will never walk alone! We all belong in two teams; an agile team to develop features based on our roadmap and a tech team which makes sure we buddy in the journey of code excellence 
  * You will deliver high quality scalable and well-tested code by following our comprehensive coding standards and follow our coding principles.
  * You will define our infrastructure and the tools we use! As a technology company, we constantly seek to upgrade our tools. Bring in your ideas!
