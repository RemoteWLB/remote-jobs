### Extreme Networks Culture

* Teamwork: The strength of a team is more powerful than an individual. We work together to drive improved performance. We pull our weight, give others credit for success, push peers to raise their game and celebrate winning as a team!
* Transparency: Each of us has a unique view about what is happening, helping, or hurting our performance. We cannot change what we cannot see. We have to know what is really going on. So, we share what we see and what is happening, not assuming others know what we know. We shine a light on it.
* Candor: We keep it real and embrace difficult conversations in a constructive way. Being honest in all of our communication is not easy. No sugarcoating and no elephants in the room, being respectful but telling the truth.
* Curiosity: Why do we win? Why do we lose? How can we do better? Where should we invest? Asking questions, committing to learning more, looking for best practices, that is the Extreme way. Being smarter than the competition. Higher intelligence drives higher performance.
* Ownership: It‚Äôs our company. We have skin in the game. We invest the time and energy to make the changes that get the best outcomes for our customers, shareholders and ourselves. We are accountable.
* Inclusion: By challenging dominant voices to listen and non-dominant voices to speak up, we gain valuable perspective that drives better decision making. By fostering diversity regardless of gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, age, or religion, we get that perspective and make more intelligent decisions that drive better business outcomes.
