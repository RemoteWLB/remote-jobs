## Description

At Kpler, we are dedicated to helping our clients navigate complex markets with ease. By simplifying global trade information and providing valuable insights, we empower organisations to make informed decisions in commodities, energy, and maritime sectors.

  

Since our founding in 2014, we have focused on delivering top-tier intelligence through user-friendly platforms. Our team of over 500 experts from 35+ countries works tirelessly to transform intricate data into actionable strategies, ensuring our clients stay ahead in a dynamic market landscape. Join us to leverage cutting-edge innovation for impactful results and experience unparalleled support on your journey to success.

  

  

Maritime domain awareness and commodity tracking involve the effective fusion of

fragmented information that compose the complex commodity flows landscape. When

combined efficiently, vessel tracking data and trading history, commodity supply and

demand, proprietary trading data, and machine learning algorithms provide an

understanding of events at ports and on open seas at different levels of granularity.

  

Rapidly evolving global geopolitical developments and tensions significantly affect

trading, disturbing the supply chain and altering commodity flow patterns which brings

more uncertainty about the modelling of these phenomena.

  

As a Senior Research Engineer with Kplerâ€™s Research Labs team, you will develop technologies that extend the state-of-the-art in the maritime, commodities and power domains and transfer research prototypes to production
