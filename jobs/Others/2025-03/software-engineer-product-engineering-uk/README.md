### Parrot  
####  

Hi üëãüèæ I‚Äôm Abhik, Ashby's Co-Founder and VP of Engineering. We‚Äôre looking for an ambitious full-stack engineer who is laser-focused on solving customer problems and making the right long-term investments to solve them not only today but in our future features and products.

What Ashby gives you in return is the best of both early and growth-stage environments. The agency and no-nonsense of a seed startup: you write product specs, make product and design decisions, and build in an almost-no-meeting culture. While also the product-market fit and scale of a growth-stage startup: thousands of daily users who depend on your software and eagerly await your next feature.

We have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing >100% year over year, very low churn, and many years of runway. We‚Äôll share more details once we meet.

# About the Role and How We Work

Our engineering culture strives to recreate the environments where we did our best work as ICs ‚Äì where we had the ownership and agency to impact our users with creative and innovative software.

I started my career building software for artists in the Visual Effects industry. It was a formative experience for me as a software engineer because success relied on my ability to be a product manager and designer. I talked to artists to understand their needs. I came up with ideas. I did industry research, designed interfaces, and prototyped ideas. I watched artists use what I built and decided what to tackle in the next iteration. No daily stand-ups, no t-shirt sizing, no planning meetings.

I studied computer science to solve problems, not tickets, and this felt exactly like that. I not only felt creative and fulfilled but the agency and ownership we were given as engineers powered an incredible amount of innovation.

Innovation came differently (or not at all) at technology startups beyond the seed stage, often through an engineer‚Äôs force of will and ability to push back against culture (rather than any encouragement from it). Engineering was narrowed to implementation and delivery, partly due to the influence of other departments and partly due to the influx of "Agile" processes like sprint planning. In those companies, I felt like a JIRA jockey.

At Ashby, we‚Äôre building an environment that is optimistic about what engineers can own and achieve. An environment that embraces innovative engineers, and, frankly, often stays out of their way. As a Product Engineer, you‚Äôll take ownership over a large portion of one of our products and own projects end-to-end (wearing hats traditionally worn by product and design). You‚Äôll research competitors, write product specs, make wireframes, and more. To ground it with examples, product engineers at Ashby have:

  * Designed and built automated interview scheduling. This feature automates scheduling by calculating possible times from a pool of interviewers and other constraints, and then presenting these times to the candidate for selection via our responsive web app. This solves the ‚ÄúCalendar Tetris‚Äù problem I talk about in "What We're Building."

  * Built a generalized declarative filter architecture that allows users to create complex filters for any record with a consistent UI and compile it to SQL in our backend. Many user-facing features use it.

  * Specced, designed, and implemented a feature that allows users to complete signing offers entirely within Ashby. This project involved talking to customers to understand their requirements, deciding what technologies to use, building a prototype, and working with other team members to integrate the final implementation into additional features.

# What We‚Äôre Building

Talent teams aspire to build a hiring process that identifies great candidates, moves them quickly through the interview process, and provides an excellent experience for the candidate. To accomplish this, recruiters perform thousands of daily tasks to coordinate and relay information between candidates, interviewers, and hiring managers. Teams struggle to keep up!

Scheduling a final round is an excellent example of our customers' challenges. A recruiter needs to collect availability from the candidate, identify potential interviewers, perform ‚ÄúCalendar Tetris‚Äù to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and perform any last-minute adjustments as availability changes. They must perform this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. ü•µ

Ashby provides talent teams with intelligent and powerful software that provides insights into where they‚Äôre failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they‚Äôre underwater with. We put a lot of effort into designing products that are approachable to beginners but mastered and extended by power users. In many ways, spreadsheets set the bar here (and are what we often replace!).

# Why You Should or Shouldn‚Äôt Apply

Software engineers come in many flavors, not all of which fit our model. Here are some things to help you decide if this fits you and what you‚Äôre looking for:

  *  _You‚Äôre not afraid to tackle any part of a technology stack._ You do what‚Äôs necessary to successfully deliver a feature, whether writing frontend or choosing new infrastructure. We‚Äôll provide a supportive environment to do it successfully (e.g., design system, SRE team).

  *  _You‚Äôve tackled projects with a lot of product and technical ambiguity, and you thrive at the intersection of the two._ We‚Äôre not building a simple CRUD app, and many of the challenges we tackle require you to use your knowledge of our customers to build powerful abstractions and flexibility in the system to solve a class of problems.

  *  _You know how to strike the right balance between speed and quality._ Ashby wasn‚Äôt built quickly. We took four years to launch publicly because convincing customers to switch required a high-quality product. However, time isn‚Äôt infinite, especially for a startup, so we still move with urgency‚Äîwe‚Äôve built the equivalent of three or more VC-backed startups with a very small team.

  *  _You are ambitious and always looking to improve your skills._ For most engineers, this role will give you more freedom and responsibilities than you‚Äôve experienced in the past. To thrive (and level up), you‚Äôll need to be open to feedback (and we give lots of it).

  *  _You‚Äôre an excellent collaborator and communicator._ Ownership and freedom don‚Äôt mean you work in a vacuum. You‚Äôll need to vet your decisions with the appropriate stakeholders, keep them up to date when necessary, and work with other engineers to get your projects across the finish line. Clear and concise communication helps a lot here!

  *  _You seek to create leverage in your work._ The nature of software is that you can often automate or abstract what would be tedious, time-consuming work. Your impatience usually leads to new abstractions, tools to allow Support to debug before Engineering, new lint rules to prevent common bugs, etc. 

**Put another way, you shouldn‚Äôt apply if:**

  *  _You need company-driven process and structure to get your projects across the finish line._ Sprint planning and well-defined project management processes are things you need or look to others to lead. You‚Äôd rather focus on the technical details and challenges.

  *  _You only want to do exciting work._ We‚Äôre building a team of kind, collaborative folks. Customer issues and investigations are distributed across the team, including our high-level ICs.

  *  _You can get lost in the details._ Once you start implementation, it can be hard to take a step back and think about the project as a whole. You like everything to be planned upfront.

  *  _You haven‚Äôt led or taken ownership of projects before._ You‚Äôre used to working with tech leads and taking on tasks distributed by them.

  *  _You want to mentor earlier-career engineers._ We rely on engineers owning their projects, so we need engineers with that experience. This requires the team to be reasonably tenured. More than 90% of the team would be considered Senior or above in the industry today, so mentorship opportunities are very limited.

  *  _To you, a tech lead, staff, or principal engineer is someone who spends most of their time project managing or doing architecture reviews._ Our most tenured engineers spend most of their time building, and we often trust them with our most challenging problems. While they lead product and technical areas and help other engineers plan their most challenging work, it‚Äôs not a requirement, nor do engineers need their sign-off.

# Engineering Culture

Our engineering culture is motivated by Benji‚Äôs (my co-founder and CEO) and my belief that a small talented team, given the right environment, can build high-quality software fast (and work regular hours!).

## Collaboration is Natural & Communication is Deliberate

Our engineering team (and the team at large) consists of lifelong learners who are humble and kind (meet them here!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally (we filter for it in interviews). We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in <2h meetings per week (I wrote about it here).

## Increase Leverage, not Team Size

We built Ashby with the quality, breadth, and depth that many customers would expect from much larger teams over larger time scales. We‚Äôve done this through investment in:

  *  **Great developer tooling.** Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 10x a day. Everyone on the team has contributed to developer experience üí™üèæ

  *  **Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast.** At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) which we are constantly improving. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below).

Here‚Äôs an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it‚Äôs like to build a feature at Ashby:

And a demo of one of these building blocks:

## Give Engineers Ownership & Agency

We, as engineers, find clever ways to solve problems, which amplifies when we deeply understand the problem. Benji and I did our best work as engineers when we had a deep understanding of the end-user and the business and ownership over the solution. Our engineering culture reflects this experience: engineers own projects end-to-end, from speaking with users to writing product specs to UX design. These are skills that we often don‚Äôt get to practice as engineers, and, at Ashby, we provide mentorship to grow them and help from the team where you want it.

## Put Effort into Diversity

Diverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups.

Today, 26% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It‚Äôs not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more.

# Interview Process

At Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We‚Äôll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions (no leetcode or whiteboard exercises). Our interview process is three rounds:

  1. 15 to 30-minute introduction call

  2. A technical screen (60-minute in-person)

  3. A virtual on-site of 3 hours and 15 minutes (can be split across multiple days) 

Your hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. You‚Äôll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with ~15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don‚Äôt give an offer, we‚Äôll provide feedback!

# Your First Two Months at Ashby

We want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment sets up with a single script, you push your first change on day one, and we spend the rest of the time building your confidence in our codebase and practices culminating in the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. We‚Äôll pair you with a peer who‚Äôll guide you through your first tasks and be someone you rely on, from answering questions to pair programming.

# Technology Stack

I‚Äôm sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don‚Äôt require previous experience in it (but a love of typed languages is helpful üòÄ): TypeScript (frontend & backend), Node.js, React, Apollo GraphQL, Postgres, Redis.

# Benefits

  * Competitive salary and equity.

  *  _10-year exercise window for stock options_. You shouldn‚Äôt feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby ‚Äîdo it when you feel financially comfortable.

  * Unlimited PTO with four weeks recommended per year. Expect ‚ÄúVacation?‚Äù in our one-on-one agenda until you start taking it üòÖ.

  *  _Twelve weeks of fully paid family leave in the US._ We plan to expand this to employees in other countries as situations arise.

  * Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive!

  * $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval.

  * If you‚Äôre in the US, top-notch health insurance for you and your dependents with all premiums covered by us.

Ashby‚Äôs success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We‚Äôre being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply.

  

Ashby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. We are committed to a diverse and inclusive workforce and welcome people from all backgrounds, experiences, perspectives, and abilities.
