Abridge was founded in 2018 with the mission of powering deeper understanding in healthcare. Our AI-powered platform was purpose-built for medical conversations, improving clinical documentation efficiencies while enabling clinicians to focus on what matters most—their patients.

Our enterprise-grade technology transforms patient-clinician conversations into structured clinical notes in real-time, with deep EMR integrations. Powered by Linked Evidence and our purpose-built, auditable AI, we are the only company that maps AI-generated summaries to ground truth, helping providers quickly trust and verify the output. As pioneers in generative AI for healthcare, we are setting the industry standards for the responsible deployment of AI across health systems.

We are a growing team of practicing MDs, AI scientists, PhDs, creatives, technologists, and engineers working together to empower people and make care make more sense.

###  **The Role**

Our generative AI-powered products are bringing joy back to the practice of medicine, and we’re looking for experienced security engineers to join our growing US-based engineering team. You’ll serve as a subject matter expert to help us build applications that are secure from current and future information security threats, and will be involved at all stages of the software development lifecycle.

###  **What You'll Do**

Every day is different at Abridge. Some of what you can expect to do:

  * Help define and implement secure coding standards, and work with engineers and engineering management to advocate for and implement these standards.

  * Perform architectural and code reviews, with a focus on secure development practices.

  * Perform threat modeling and risk assessment, both standalone and as part of our larger security and compliance program.

  * Identify and remediate security vulnerabilities through manual and automated testing.

  * Incorporate automated tools such as SAST / DAST / RASP / SCA into the development process, such as by augmenting CI + CD pipelines.

  * Lead triage of incoming issues, and work with engineering teams to remediate known or suspected security vulnerabilities.

  * Train and mentor engineers on secure development practices. 

  * Research commercial and open-source solutions, and make build vs buy recommendations to bring new capabilities into the technology organization.

  * Build deep user empathy and maintain a user-centric mindset

  * Communicate regularly and effectively within and on behalf of our cross-functional product delivery teams. You’ll work with other disciplines including product, machine learning, and platform engineering, and will have opportunities to learn from and contribute to projects across the company.

###  **What You’ll Bring**

  * 7+ years of software engineering experience, with several years of experience focusing on cybersecurity for cloud-native applications. You’ve seen what works, and probably a few things that didn’t work. Your opinions are grounded in experience.

  * Passionate about software security, and experienced at multiple levels of the stack. You can determine whether a piece of code is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting attack; debate the relative merits of CBC vs GCM; and architect a system with appropriate data segregation for confidential data.

  * Experienced working in a regulated environment. You have worked with compliance frameworks such as SOC2 and HITRUST.

  * Up-to-date on industry best-practices and trends, and enjoy of learning new things

  * Excited about being hands-on in a fast-moving, productive, and supportive environment

  * Willing to pitch in wherever needed - as a fast-moving startup we need to do good work, quickly

##  **Life at Abridge**

At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.

Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.

##  **Diversity & Inclusion**

Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).
