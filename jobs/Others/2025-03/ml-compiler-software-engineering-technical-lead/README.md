####  

At **d-Matrix** , we are focused on unleashing the potential of generative AI to power the transformation of technology. We are at the forefront of software and hardware innovation, pushing the boundaries of what is possible. Our culture is one of **respect and collaboration.**

We value humility and believe in direct communication. Our **team is inclusive** , and our differing perspectives allow for better solutions. We are seeking individuals passionate about tackling challenges and are driven by execution. Ready to come find your playground? **Together** , we can help shape the endless possibilities of AI.

**Location:**

Hybrid, working onsite at our Santa Clara, CA headquarters 3 days per week.

 **The role:** **MLIR Software Engineering Technical Lead / Principal**

 **What you will do:**

The Compiler Technical Lead role is driving the design and implementation of the MLIR-based compiler framework. In this role, you will be overseeing the development of the compiler that partitions and maps large-scale NLP models to our scalable, multi-chiplet, parallel processing architecture with hundreds of digital in-memory tensor processors, vector processors, data shaping processors and both on-chip and off-chip memory. The compiler will also coordinate the scheduling of parallel tasks onto the processors, data movements and inter processor synchronization. The many-pass compiler architecture requires graph optimization passes, constant folding, data reshaping, padding, tiling and various other backend-specific operations. The software will support a split offline/online mapping process with just-in-time mapping to chiplets, processors and DDR memory channels.

This role requires collaborating with the HW and SW architecture team, the Pytorch front-end pre-processing team, the data science numerics team, AI kernel team, SW test group, the benchmark group and the teams developing the various simulator and emulation platforms. It is central to the overall efficiency of the solution. As such, we are seeking an AI compiler expert with experience in the TVM, Glow or preferably, the MLIR project. Also important is familiarity with the LLVM project. Experience mapping graph operations to many-core processors (or spatial fabrics) would be desirable.

This role does NOT require hardware design or verification experience. That said, an understanding of the trade-offs made by processor architects when implementing accelerators for DNNs, DCNNs, transformer models and attention mechanisms is useful - especially when it comes to mapping very large NLP models to such architectures.

 **What you will bring:**

Minimum:

  * BS / MS Preferred in Computer Science or equivalent with 12+ years in ML Compiler.

  * Experience establishing, growing and/or developing engineering teams (and software teams in particular). 

  * Experience with leading agile development methods is preferable including coordinating scrums, managing sprints and project task tracking with Kanban boards or similar. 

  * Experience running code reviews, bug tracking meetings, familiarity and experience with CI/CD flows. 

  * Managing interdependencies with other teams in order to meet milestones and target levels of performance. 

  * Excellent documentation and presentation skills.

This role includes technical leadership aspects: specifically the motivation, engagement, goal setting, performance tracking, objective setting and performance management.
