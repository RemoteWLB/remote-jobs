**About the Team**

Security is at the foundation of OpenAI’s mission to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.

The Security team protects OpenAI’s technology, people, and products. We are technical in what we build but are operational in how we do our work, and are committed to supporting all products and research at OpenAI. Our Security team tenets include: prioritizing for impact, enabling researchers, preparing for future transformative technologies, and engaging a robust security culture.

**About the Role**

Trusted Computing and Cryptography is a core security team at OpenAI focused on deploying high-performance cryptography at scale, secure key management, and trusted hardware enclaves—from boot measurements to GPU confidential computation. As a Hardware Security Engineer, you’ll own hardware security at OpenAI by co-designing secure chipsets and integrating cryptographic techniques into our production systems.

 **In this role, you will:**

  *  **Co-Design Secure Hardware:** Collaborate with hardware vendors and cross-functional teams (kernel, compiler, and ML engineers) to design future secure hardware that meets performance and cryptographic needs.

  *  **Develop Critical Software:** Write performance-critical code in Rust, Python, and C/C++ to build cryptographic libraries and secure key management systems.

  *  **Integrate Security Primitives:** Architect and deploy systems using TPM2, Secure Boot, Nitro Enclaves, Intel SGX, AMD-SEV, and other secure hardware technologies.

  *  **Drive Innovation:** Engage with internal and external partners to align hardware innovations with OpenAI’s trusted computing and cryptographic requirements.

 **You might thrive in this role if you have:**

  * 10+ years of industry experience in hardware security or hardware–software co-design.

  * Proven expertise in deploying cryptographic systems at scale and integrating secure hardware primitives.

  * Strong coding skills in Rust and/or C/C++, with proficiency in Python.

  * Proven ability to collaborate across teams, architect solutions, and debug complex production systems.

  * A proactive, ownership-driven mindset with a focus on end-to-end problem solving.

 **Nice to Have**

  * Advanced degree in Computer Architecture, Electrical Engineering, or related fields.

  * Familiarity with HPC, low-precision computing, and SIMD architectures.
