 **About LaunchDarkly:**

Modern software delivery was supposed to be the foundation for a thriving digital business but reality has proven otherwise. Slow, inefficient development cycles, costly outages, and fragmented customer experiences are preventing developers from building their best software. The LaunchDarkly platform helps developers innovate on new features faster while protecting them with a safety valve to instantly rewind when things go wrong. Developers can target product experiences to any customer segment and maximize the business impact of every feature. And by gradually rolling out new application components, they escape nightmare "big-bang" technology migrations.

The LaunchDarkly platform was built to guide engineers to the next frontier of DevOps by:

  * Improving the velocity and stability of software releases, without the fear of end customer outages

  * Delivering targeted experiences by easily personalizing features to customer cohorts

  * Maximizing the business impact of every feature through the ability to experiment and optimize

  * Coordinating the release and optimization of software to provide consistent experiences across mobile platforms and device types

  * Improving the effectiveness and productivity of engineering teams, by providing insights into engineering cadence and stability
