**About the Team**

Security is at the foundation of OpenAI’s mission to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.

The Security team protects OpenAI’s technology, people, and products. We are technical in what we build but are operational in how we do our work, and are committed to supporting all products and research at OpenAI. Our Security team tenets include: prioritizing for impact, enabling researchers, preparing for future transformative technologies, and engaging a robust security culture.

**About the Role**

We are looking for a Security Engineer to join our Cloud Security and Identity team. As a Security Engineer, you will play a crucial role in building secure systems and implementing effective security measures based on input from cross-functional partners. Leveraging your strong engineering skills and deep security knowledge, you will collaborate with cross-functional teams to design and develop secure software solutions and infrastructure. Additionally, you will work closely with partners to understand their requirements and ensure that security is ingrained into the fabric of OpenAI's systems. This role requires a proactive and resilient team player who can work cross-functionally and help build a cohesive security team.

This role is open to remote employees, or relocation assistance is available to one of our OpenAI offices in San Francisco, Seattle, or New York City.

 **In this role, you will:**

  * Design and implement scalable security systems and controls to protect data center infrastructure, ensuring robust protection across a global footprint.

  * Collaborate with engineering, operations, and security teams to enforce security best practices, including network segmentation, identity management, and access control policies.

  * Deploy and manage security measures for on-premise environments, including firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and secure remote access solutions.

  * Assess, monitor, and mitigate physical and cyber risks across data centers, ensuring compliance with industry standards and regulatory requirements.

  * Automate security operations by integrating security monitoring, logging, and response mechanisms for data center infrastructure.

  * Develop and enforce secure configurations for bare-metal servers, hypervisors, network appliances, and storage systems to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.

  * Engage with vendors and partners to assess the security of third-party hardware and software used in data center deployments.

 **You might thrive in this role if you have:**

  * Deep understanding of security principles, best practices, and common vulnerabilities.

  * A proactive mindset, with the ability to identify and address security gaps or inefficiencies through automation and tooling.

  * A track record of delivering scalable solutions and driving impactful changes across infrastructure in real-world projects.

  * Expertise in the security of cloud platforms (e.g., Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure), especially securing multi-cloud networks and infrastructure, and designing cloud agnostic systems.

  * Experience securing on-prem deployments and datacenters from construction to multi-tenant use.

  * Familiarity with container security, orchestration security, and authentication/authorization.

  * Strong analytical and problem-solving skills, with an ability to think critically and objectively assess security risks.

  * Excellent communication skills, with the ability to convey complex security concepts to technical and non-technical stakeholders.

  * Excitement about collaborating with cross-functional teams to build secure, reliable systems that scale globally.
