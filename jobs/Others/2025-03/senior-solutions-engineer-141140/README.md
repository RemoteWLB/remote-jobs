Solutions Engineering at Ironclad

Solution Engineers (SEs) are Ironclad Sales Team’s pre-sale technical experts. SEs collaborate closely with prospects and Ironclad’s Sales, Implementation, and Product teams, forming a critical technical overlay to the sales and solution evaluation.

At Ironclad, SEs are creative, value-driven technology experts that love to engage with people. They drive sales through clear communication focusing on customer use cases, technology infrastructure, and solution design. With a comprehensive understanding of Ironclad’s platform, SEs empower prospects to understand how Ironclad can work for them.

SEs also help Ironclad improve our platform: the best SEs help capture the most challenging technical requirements observed in the market and translate them into actionable insights for Ironclad’s Product team to develop.

 **Requirements, you must be:**

  *  **Mission-oriented:** You’re excited to work on a team that operates at the intersection of human talent and software; you want to put that passion to work in an industry that still skews heavily towards human/manual work. You want to work at a place where you can have an outsized impact.

  *  **Exceptional communicator:** You’re a strong verbal communicator, able to capture an audience with clear and confident language. You can understand and empathize with people even if you have limited subject-matter knowledge of their area of expertise.

  *  **Technically proficient:** You’re an expert at technical configuration and familiar with or have an appetite for learning and you recognize that a willingness to develop technical skills is an important part of what makes SEs successful in their role as solution experts.

  *  **Team player:** You can work effectively in teams of technical and non-technical individuals. You are energized by collaborating with diverse teams.

  *  **Independent:** You can learn and drive outcomes with minimal supervision. You have a bias toward action and gravitate towards environments where you have an outsized influence on the success of customers and colleagues. You are exceptionally good at making trade-offs based on incomplete data.

  * Experience: 5+ years of Enterprise Solution Engineering experience
