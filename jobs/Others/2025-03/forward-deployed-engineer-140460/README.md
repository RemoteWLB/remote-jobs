Sitting in between Pre-Sales, Post-Sales, and Engineering, the Forward Deployment Engineering team addresses the need for a fast action, technical role, who can enter into any stage of the customer lifecycle - aiding in various, value multiplying efforts. Answering questions from “How does this work?” to “Why doesn’t this work?” to “Can you make this work?” covering the three distinct areas of our workflow. Split across various work types, this role requires the ability to spin up quickly on the technical implementation and customer context, while retaining an advanced knowledge of product features to measure problems or requests against.

The FDE team is passionate about serving others and enabling them through our technical capabilities seasoned with customer centricity. We are brought into a wide spectrum of conversations and work from customer support, pre-sales and post sales enablement, and R&D feature roadmap. Given our skill set and location amongst the teams, we are able to quickly build tools to meet needs for clients both internal and external. We see your time (both in and outside of work) as valuable and not something to be wasted. In that we plan our efforts as efficiently as possible while maintaining speed.

A list of job experiences and qualification requirements is great, but humility, a performance-driven attitude, and a team-player approach are most important to us. We love to have fun and win in the process. We only hire people who have a passion for building great companies in an environment where a sense of humor is a must

With the help of our customers, we have built the first Engineering Management Platform, providing visibility into engineering organizations, their work, and how they operate. We enable leaders to align engineering decisions with business initiatives and deliver the right software efficiently and on time.
