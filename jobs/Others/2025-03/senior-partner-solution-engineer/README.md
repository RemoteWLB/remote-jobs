To support our explosive growth we have built an expansive Partner Ecosystem that includes technology vendors such as dbt, Fivetran, Sigma, and many more. These technology partners, who Snowflake refers to as Data Cloud Product partners, play a key role in extending native Snowflake functionality and also building innovative joint solutions for our customers across many use-cases like Analytics, Data Integration, Data Science, and Security & Governance.

We are looking for a Partner Solution Engineer who is passionate about working with our Data Cloud Product partners to help them build cutting-edge integrations and solutions for our joint customers. In this role, you will work directly with the partner management team and Data Cloud Product partners to understand the needs of our customers, strategize on product integrations with partners, provide technical guidance, evangelize the joint solutions, and ultimately assist partners in co-selling activities.

As a Snowflake Partner Solution Engineer you must share our passion for reinventing the AI Data Cloud, thrive in a dynamic environment, and have the flexibility and willingness to jump in and get things done. You are equally comfortable in both a business and technical context, interacting with executives and talking shop with technical audiences.

  * Engage with the Product team and influence the Snowflake product roadmap based on customer needs and strategic initiatives

  * Build technical assets such as white papers, blog posts, best practices documents, virtual hands-on labs, and quickstarts to accelerate the adoption of joint solutions

  * Evangelize joint solutions and product integrations by speaking at conferences, webinars, and other marketing events

  * Present Snowflake technology and vision to executives and technical contributors at prospects and customers

  * Immerse yourself in the ever-evolving industry, maintaining a deep understanding of competitive and complementary technologies and vendors and how to position Snowflake in relation to them.

  * Collaborate with Product Management, Engineering, and Marketing to continuously improve Snowflake’s products and messaging

  * Build assets to enable Snowflake Solution Engineers on partner integrations and solutions  

## ON DAY ONE WE WILL EXPECT YOU TO HAVE:

  * 7-8 years of industry experience with a minimum of 3 within a pre-sales/customer facing role

  * Broad range of experience with large-scale database or data warehouse technologies

  * Understanding of cloud architectures and services involving SaaS solutions with any of the popular cloud providers (Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure)

  * Outstanding presentation skills for both technical and business audiences, whether impromptu on a whiteboard, or using presentations and demos

  * Ability to connect a customer’s specific business problems and Snowflake’s solutions

  * Experience architecting solutions with ISV technologies from at least one of the following categories: analytics, data engineering, data science, security & governance

  * Hands-on expertise with SQL and Python

  * University degree in computer science, engineering, mathematics or related fields, or equivalent experience  

Our Solution Engineers are customer-obsessed and we believe in the value we can add. We love to learn, are open to giving and receiving feedback, and are passionate about making our clients successful.

Snowflake is growing fast, and we’re scaling our team to help enable and accelerate our growth. We are looking for people who share our values, challenge ordinary thinking, and push the pace of innovation while building a future for themselves and Snowflake.
