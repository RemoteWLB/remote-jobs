**About the Team**

Security is at the foundation of OpenAI’s mission to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.

The Security team protects OpenAI’s technology, people, and products. We are technical in what we build but are operational in how we do our work, and are committed to supporting all products and research at OpenAI. Our Security team tenets include: prioritizing for impact, enabling researchers, preparing for future transformative technologies, and engaging a robust security culture.

**About the Role**

We are looking for a Security Engineer to join our Cloud Security and Identity team. As a Security Engineer, you will play a crucial role in building secure systems and implementing effective security measures based on input from cross-functional partners. Leveraging your strong engineering skills and deep security knowledge, you will collaborate with cross-functional teams to design and develop secure software solutions and infrastructure. Additionally, you will work closely with partners to understand their requirements and ensure that security is ingrained into the fabric of OpenAI's systems. This role requires a proactive and resilient team player who can work cross-functionally and help build a cohesive security team.

This role is open to remote employees, or relocation assistance is available to one of our OpenAI offices in San Francisco, Seattle, or New York City.

 **In this role, you will:**

  * Design and implement scalable systems and controls to secure infrastructure, ensuring robust functionality across a global footprint.

  * Collaborate with engineering and security teams to drive deployment of security enhancements and control changes across broad-scale infrastructure.

  * Deliver on key projects that enhance security operations, from improving infrastructure visibility to automating routine tasks and workflows.

  * Take a generalist approach to building security controls, balancing a mix of security expertise and broad technical skillsets to adapt to evolving challenges.

  * This role involves a combination of partnership, hands-on engineering, infrastructure security, and automation to support OpenAI’s mission of creating safe and beneficial artificial general intelligence.

  * Build enduring and high-trust partnerships with colleagues across the organization.

 **You might thrive in this role if you have:**

  * Deep understanding of security principles, best practices, and common vulnerabilities.

  * A proactive mindset, with the ability to identify and address security gaps or inefficiencies through automation and tooling.

  * A track record of delivering scalable solutions and driving impactful changes across infrastructure in real-world projects.

  * Expertise in the security of cloud platforms (e.g., Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure), especially securing multi-cloud networks and infrastructure, and designing cloud agnostic systems.

  * Familiarity with container security, orchestration security, and authentication/authorization.

  * Strong analytical and problem-solving skills, with an ability to think critically and objectively assess security risks.

  * Excellent communication skills, with the ability to convey complex security concepts to technical and non-technical stakeholders.

  * Excitement about collaborating with cross-functional teams to build secure, reliable systems that scale globally.
