Abridge was founded in 2018 with the mission of powering deeper understanding in healthcare. Our AI-powered platform was purpose-built for medical conversations, improving clinical documentation efficiencies while enabling clinicians to focus on what matters most—their patients.

Our enterprise-grade technology transforms patient-clinician conversations into structured clinical notes in real-time, with deep EMR integrations. Powered by Linked Evidence and our purpose-built, auditable AI, we are the only company that maps AI-generated summaries to ground truth, helping providers quickly trust and verify the output. As pioneers in generative AI for healthcare, we are setting the industry standards for the responsible deployment of AI across health systems.

We are a growing team of practicing MDs, AI scientists, PhDs, creatives, technologists, and engineers working together to empower people and make care make more sense.

 **The Role**

We’re looking for Software Engineering Interns to join Abridge’s San Francisco Internship cohort for a 10-12 week program. In this role, you’ll collaborate with our experienced software engineering team to build and ship real-world product features using a modern web stack (primarily in Typescript). With mentorship and guidance, you’ll gain hands-on experience designing, coding, and releasing software that makes a meaningful impact to making clinicians’ lives easier.

 **What You'll Do**

  * Design and build end-to-end features, enhancing our existing systems to add new functionality.

  * Fix user-facing bugs and issues and make quality-of-life improvements to the codebase.

  * Develop a strong user-centric mindset, building empathy for Abridge’s clinicians and the challenges they face.

  * Collaborate across our cross-functional product teams, working closely with design, product, machine learning, and infrastructure to ship features to our customers.

  * Receive guidance from an experienced software engineering mentor as well as collaborate one-on-one with teammates within your pod.

 **What We’re Looking For**

  * Experience with Typescript, React, and Node.js or Next.js.

  * Prior hands-on experience developing web applications (e.g., internship, co-op, or personal projects).

  * A strong interest in pursuing a full-time software engineering role in 2026—high-performing interns are eligible to receive a return offer.

  * A curious, adaptable, and proactive mindset, with a desire to learn and grow in a fast-paced startup environment.

  * A willingness to pitch in wherever needed—we move fast, and we need team players who are eager to contribute.

 **Base Salary: $40 / hr**

 **Must be willing to work from our San Francisco office at least 3x per week**

This internship is based in our San Francisco office. To support relocation, Abridge will cover flights to and from San Francisco at the start and end of the program. Rent and living expenses will be factored into the internship salary package.

We value people who want to learn new things, and we know that great team members might not perfectly match a job description. If you’re interested in the role but aren’t sure whether or not you’re a good fit, we’d still like to hear from you.

##  **Life at Abridge**

At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.

Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.

##  **Diversity & Inclusion**

Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).

##  **Staying Safe - Protect Yourself From Recruitment Fraud**

We are aware of individuals and entities fraudulently representing themselves as Abridge recruiters and/or hiring managers. Abridge will never ask for financial information or payment, or for personal information such as bank account number or social security number during the job application or interview process. Any emails from the Abridge recruiting team will come from an @abridge.com email address. You can learn more about how to protect yourself from these types of fraud by referring to this article. Please exercise caution and cease communications if something feels suspicious about your interactions.
