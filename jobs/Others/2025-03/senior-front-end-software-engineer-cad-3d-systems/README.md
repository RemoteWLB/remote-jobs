Dandy is transforming the massive ($200B) but antiquated dental industry. Backed by some of the world's leading venture capital investors, we are on an ambitious mission to integrate and simplify every function of the dental practice through technology. By building the operating system for every dental office in America, Dandy is empowering dentists with technology, innovation, and world-class support to achieve more for their practice, their people, and their patients.

Dandy is hiring a team of talented software engineers to build digital products and technological infrastructure to support a vertically integrated pipeline for the manufacturing of dental prosthetics.

In this role, you will build beautiful, interactive UIs and 3D visualizations for CAD-type programs with integrated AI and interface with 3D model backend processing pipelines that power key aspects of the company. You know how to employ the best tools of the trade, but when needed you can get farther into the weeds to optimize algorithms, data input, and processing environment.

The ideal candidate is a technology enthusiast with a strong web UI and graphics development skill set, experience in 3D graphics, game development, or strong experience in lower-level 3D image processing.

  * Advocate for new technical architecture and innovation

 **Requirements**

  * 6+ years of software engineering experience, preferably in a high growth environment 

  * A portfolio of relevant works

  * 3D model or visualization programming experience (e.g. Three.js, WebGL, opencv, trimesh or similar).

  * Understanding of 3D data structures, matrices, transforms, algorithms, and rendering techniques

  * Deep knowledge of JavaScript and its ecosystem, and experience developing large JS/TS applications; up-to-date on the latest JavaScript and design technology, trends, and industry news.

  * Basic understanding of SQL and relational design patterns

  * Genuine believer in constructive and respectful code reviews, retros, and collaborative problem-solving as the bedrock of a healthy team and experience utilizing these as mentorship vectors.

  * Collaborative, pragmatic, and growth-oriented mindset. Regularly achieve consensus with peers and provide clear status updates.

  * Ability to clearly and concisely communicate about complex technical, architectural, and/or organizational problems and propose thorough iterative solutions. 

  * Self-motivated and self-managing, with excellent organizational skills. 

  * Ability to thrive in a remote-first organization.
