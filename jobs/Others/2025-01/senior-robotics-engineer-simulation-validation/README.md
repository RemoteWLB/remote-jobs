### Serve Robotics  
####  

At Serve Robotics, we’re reimagining how things move in cities. Our personable sidewalk robot is our vision for the future. It’s designed to take deliveries away from congested streets, make deliveries available to more people, and benefit local businesses. The Serve fleet has been delighting merchants, customers, and pedestrians along the way in Los Angeles while doing commercial deliveries.

The Serve fleet has been delighting merchants, customers, and pedestrians along the way in Los Angeles while doing commercial deliveries. We’re looking for talented individuals who will grow robotic deliveries from surprising novelty to efficient ubiquity.

###  **Who We Are**

We are tech industry veterans in software, hardware, and design who are pooling our skills to build the future we want to live in. We are solving real-world problems leveraging robotics, machine learning and computer vision, among other disciplines, with a mindful eye towards the end-to-end user experience. Our team is agile, diverse, and driven. We believe that the best way to solve complicated dynamic problems is collaboratively and respectfully.

Serve Robotics aims to develop dependable and proficient sidewalk autonomy software. Our Autonomy team is looking for an enthusiastic individual capable of addressing challenging issue of building automated testing software that can speed up our insights generation as we iterate on technology development. Ideal candidate has a good sense to automate tools that helps developer productivity (Like running Autonomy Stack from Docker using log replay from recorded clips), builds simulation pipeline to test hard cases that’s not easy to test in real world, Manage CI/CD runs for model regressions, helps QA with building tools that expedites the testing cycles.

 **Responsibilities**

  * Build open loop simulation system, tailored towards the environment of our sidewalk robot. Develop scenarios depicting real world situations for testing autonomy algorithms.

  * Build and integrate on-robot software modules with simulation engine.

  * Responsible for the software release testing process.

  * Ensure the quality and performance of the autonomy software through continuous improvement of testing processes and methodologies.

  * Implement automatic metrics generation pipeline from benchmark regression datasets that runs Autonomy stack to compare different software version runs.

  * Develop test and processes to validate the performance of hardware and software.

  * Support software feature testing.

 **Qualifications**

  * Bachelors in Computer Science or related field or equivalent work experience.

  * 5+ years of experience in developing automation and simulation scenarios for robots or similar technologies.

  * Proficient in creating simulation scenarios using simulation rendering engines like Gazebo, with a specific focus on robotics.

  * Experience deploying automated testing for hardware systems at scale.

  * Collaborate with development and product teams to understand requirements and create effective testing strategies

  * Experience with core QA methodologies, including problem isolation techniques, regression testing, or systems integration testing.

  * Strong C++ and Python or equivalent scripting language experience. Has written automation pipelines with them that improves ease of testing capability of complex robotic systems.

  * Highly motivated teammate with excellent oral and written communication skills.

 **What makes you standout**

  * Experience with Nvidia IsaacSim, Blender, USD, digital asset creation

  * Experience with Docker, CI/CD systems, gcp, big query, and build systems like bazel

  * Experience contributing to open source robotic software such as ROS2  
DevOps experience
