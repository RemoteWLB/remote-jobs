# [Senior Frontend Developer (US Only)](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/senior-frontend-developer-us-only)  
### G2i Inc.  
####  

**Duration:** 5/6-6/28 at 40 hours/week

Instrument has been partnering with AWS to redesign their core design system for the public facing marketing site. To help speed up velocity of the transition, they are looking for extra development support (2-4 developers) to be embedded within the AWS team to develop patterns that are sitting in the backlog. The work will be in React, and will start with more simple "patterns" (re: components) and then there is an opportunity to advance into more feature work as you get used to the tech stack.

### Ideal skills

  * React for rendering, Jest for testing, Playwright for integration tests and Storybook for dev testing components.

  * Custom-build sandbox for dev testing templates.

  * A conceptual understanding of CI/CD is fine, but all those tools are internal so you wonâ€™t be familiar with them unless you've worked here.

  * Basic experience with Figma is a bonus for specs (it's not too difficult for us to onboard).

  * Proactive communication and comfort with ambiguity.

  * Solid animation/motion skills (for frontend), generalist skills across a broad set of tools and frameworks, high fidelity site experience, ability to solve design challenges in frontend development.
