## About Standard Bots

Standard Botâ€™s mission is to significantly lower the barrier to entry to real-world automation, bringing the power of bits to the world of atoms and unlocking productivity for entire new industries and users.

Our AI product allows robots to tackle applications theyâ€™ve never been able to tackle before, with the simplest instruction interface.

### About the Role

Our AI team is looking for simulation engineers to empower our robotic arms to perform complex sequences of tasks in physical workplaces for our customers. Weâ€™re seeking simulation engineers to help architect the future of robotics by helping us bridge the sim-to-real gap for deploying our AI models to our robots. Robotics experience is not necessary, we think if you have experience in autonomous vehicles, gaming or AR/VR, the skills will translate nicely.

ðŸ’¡Experience with AI or robotics isnâ€™t required; weâ€™re looking for experienced engineers ready to make a tangible impact in the AI robotics revolution. If you're excited to be part of the team building the future of intelligent automation, weâ€™d love to hear from you.

 **In this role, you will:**

  * Design and implement high-fidelity simulation environments that accurately model real-world physics and robot dynamics

  * Build and maintain simulation infrastructure that accelerates our AI model development cycle through:

    * Predictive success metrics for pre-deployment validation

    * Automated benchmarking systems integrated with CI/CD pipelines

    * Enables rapid A/B testing of model iterations

  * Design and implement simulation-based evaluation metrics that correlate with real-world AI model performance, including task completion rates, generalization capabilities, and robustness measures

  * Develop synthetic data generation pipelines that help improve model training efficiency and reduce sim-to-real gaps

  * Collaborate with AI, robotics, and product teams to ensure simulation environments meet real-world deployment needs

 **You might thrive in this role if you:**

  * Have 5+ years of engineering experience, especially in tech and product-driven environments.

  * Have experience with game engines (Unity, Unreal, etc.), AR/VR/XR or physics simulators (e.g. Mujoco, IsaacSim, Drake, Pybullet, Gazebo)

  * Support AI research through simulation and pre-deployment validation metrics

  * Believe in the potential of AI to reshape industries, even if youâ€™re new to the field.

  * Bonus points if you experience in a deployed robotics environment

### Tech Stack

  * Python

  * NodeJS/Typescript

  * React

  * Docker

### About Standard Bots

Standard Bots is transforming robotics by building an accessible AI-powered platform for companies of all sizes. Designed and assembled in the U.S., our robots are programmed through simple demonstrations, rather than complex coding. By streamlining every step of the AI workflowâ€”from data collection to model deploymentâ€”weâ€™re empowering businesses to achieve new efficiencies and tackle diverse challenges across sectors. Our goal is to make intelligent robotics as ubiquitous and accessible as smartphones, fundamentally changing the role of automation in society.
