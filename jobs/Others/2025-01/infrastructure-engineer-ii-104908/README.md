## Description

At Scribd (pronounced ‚Äúscribbed‚Äù), our mission is to spark human curiosity. Join our team as we create a world of stories and knowledge, democratize the exchange of ideas and information, and empower collective expertise through our three products: Everand, Scribd, and Slideshare.

  

We support a culture where our employees can be real and be bold; where we debate and commit as we embrace plot twists; and where every employee is empowered to take action as we prioritize the customer.

  

Our flexible work benefit - Scribd Flex - enables employees, in partnership with their manager, to choose the daily work-style that best suits their individual needs. As an organization, we prioritize collaboration and intentional in-person moments to build culture and connection. For this reason, occasional in-person attendance is required for all Scribd employees, regardless of their location.

  

**About The Team**

  

Core Infrastructure owns the design, operation, and maintenance of our AWS Cloud infrastructure. As an infrastructure engineer, you will be part of implementing solutions to support the continued growth of Scribd.

  

‚Ä¢ You will be part of the team that manages our existing AWS Cloud Environment while helping service owners adjust to a new AWS-centric model.

‚Ä¢ You will help in this shift from a traditional operations organization into a services organization that provides key components to our backend technology stack such as container orchestration infrastructure, logging services, monitoring and alerting patterns, caching layers, and relational/non-relational clustered data storage.

‚Ä¢ You and your team will educate developers and help delegate traditional operational responsibilities to teams that are already taking an increased level of ownership of their production environment.

‚Ä¢ Sharing your experience and good judgment will be crucial to helping these teams scale their services operationally for years to come.
