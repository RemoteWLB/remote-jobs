### Serotonin  
#### `ðŸ’° Competitive salary and benefits package.` `ðŸŒŽ remote,New York`  

## Description

Join our client as they accelerate the ZK revolution, supporting web3 networks with reliable and cost-efficient proof generation. They are a high-performance cryptography startup with an exciting hardware twist looking for a talented Compiler Engineer.

  

About the role:

As a Senior Compiler Engineer, you will build tools to express computations on two types of novel machines, one digital and one virtual. The goals in these areas of our tech stack are:

  

Expression of verifiable programs with ZK constraint systems.

Translation of algorithms to target a custom cryptographic processor running on an FPGA.

  

You will work closely with the hardware and cryptography teams to define both the instruction sets and high-level program representations. The tools you build may be embedded programming languages, special-purpose compilers, and machine emulators. This work will have a direct impact on Irreducibleâ€™s success by improving the productâ€™s developer experience, performance, and security.
