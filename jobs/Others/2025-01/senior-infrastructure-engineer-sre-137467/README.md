You'll collaborate closely with our service engineering teams to automate processes, streamline operations, and ensure optimal system performance and reliability in our cloud infrastructure on AWS and GCP.

We are particularly interested in candidates with software engineering experience in languages like Java, Python, or TypeScript. This background will allow you to collaborate effectively with product teams, build tools and automation, and improve the developer experience across our engineering organization. Youâ€™ll have the opportunity to influence key infrastructure and architecture decisions while ensuring high reliability and smooth delivery pipelines.

This remote role requires a minimum of 5 years of cloud infrastructure experience.

### **What youâ€™ll do**

  * Collaborate with service engineering teams to design, implement, and maintain scalable and resilient infrastructure solutions optimizing for performance, resilience, and cost.
  * Ensure infrastructure aligns with business requirements and industry standards.
  * Leverage Terraform to automate infrastructure provisioning and configurations.
  * Implement SRE principles to improve system reliability and reduce downtime.
  * Improve developer workflows by creating self-service tools, optimizing CI/CD pipelines, and enhancing deployment processes to remove friction.
  * Develop and maintain robust monitoring and alerting systems to proactively identify and resolve issues.
  * Lead incident responses, manage on-call rotations, and facilitate post-incident reviews to drive continuous improvement and resilience.
  * Automate everythingâ€”drive adoption of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and build automated pipelines for testing, monitoring, and deployments.
  * Leverage your excellent written and verbal communication skills, to create communications on upcoming changes and how they affect teams.

### **Key qualifications**

  * Proven experience in building, scaling and monitoring cloud infrastructure on AWS, especially EKS, S3, RDS, API Gateway, Load Balancers, VPC, Lambdas, DocumentDB and DynamoDB.
  * Proven experience using Terraform to update and maintain cloud infrastructure.
  * Proven experience with containerized applications, kubernetes and microservice deployments.
  * Strong knowledge of GitHub Actions and CI/CD best practices.
  * Experience with developer productivity tools: designing CI/CD workflows, building internal tools, and creating self-service solutions to streamline software development.
  * Knowledge of monitoring and observability tools and frameworks, with working knowledge of Datadog being a plus.
  * Familiarity with networking concepts (DNS, load balancing, firewalls, VPNs).
  * Strong collaboration skills with the ability to work effectively across teams and communicate technical ideas clearly.
  * Experience coding/reading in one of the industry standard language such as Java, Python, TypeScript
