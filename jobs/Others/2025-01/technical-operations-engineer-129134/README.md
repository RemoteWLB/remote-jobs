We value diversity â€” in backgrounds and experiences. We need people from all backgrounds and walks of life to help build the future of audit and advisory. Fieldguideâ€™s team is inclusive, driven, humble, and supportive.

We make audit practitionersâ€™ lives easier by eliminating up to 50% of their work and giving them a better work-life balance. If you share our values and enthusiasm for building a great culture and product, you will find a home at Fieldguide.
