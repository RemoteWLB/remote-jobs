## Description

 **About the Company**

  

Hi, we're Ondo Finance. Our mission is to provide institutional-grade, blockchain-enabled investment products and services. We have both a technology arm that develops decentralized finance technology, and an asset management arm that creates and manages tokenized funds. We were the first company to tokenize exposure to US Treasuries, and have since expanded into several other assets. We are also focused on incubating protocols that can support both tokenized real-world assets and traditional crypto.

  

Founded by folks from Goldman Sachs Digital Assets Team, weâ€™re backed by some of the best investors in the world including Founders Fund, Coinbase Ventures, Pantera Capital, Tiger Global, and more. We are currently the leaders in the space in terms of AUM and are well capitalized to continue growing the firm. We're fully remote, with team members across the U.S.

  

 **About the role**

  

Weâ€™re looking for an experienced Senior Developer Relations Lead to help build a thriving developer ecosystem for Ondo Financeâ€™s ambitious new 0-1 initiative. We are building core web3 infrastructure to become the worldâ€™s foremost Real World Asset (RWA) blockchain platform - ensuring we can meet the performance, security, and functionality requirements of 3rd party institutions and developers/protocols building on top of Ondo.

  

This role is for an experienced and passionate web3 builder to found our Developer Relations function. Youâ€™ll work closely with Engineering, Product, Security, Operations and Business Development to make Ondo the best platform to mint new RWAs and build novel experiences on top of existing and future Ondo RWAs.

  

You should have experience in a Developer Relations capacity for a web3 protocol, with video/writing samples of some of your external-facing work. You should have not only a deep knowledge of modern DeFi protocols, but also some expertise on the architecture and ecosystem decisions behind key L1 and L2 blockchains. Bonus points for those with direct experience working on Cosmos SDK or for a L1/L2 blockchain.

â€¢Be one of the technical faces of Ondoâ€™s upcoming 0 to 1 RWA web3 infrastructure

â€¢Make it easier for 3rd party developers to build on top of Ondo infrastructure through open-source contributions, tutorials, articles and code examples

â€¢Work with BD and Engineering to facilitate hackathons and developer programs

â€¢Identify builder needs and pain points, work with product and engineering teams to account for these in the infrastructure roadmap

â€¢Own, scope and execute on a roadmap to bring to life novel, 0 to 1 Real World Asset web3 infrastructure for Ondo. Ruthlessly prioritize to ship a MVP by end of year and continue iterating based off of developer and user feedback.

â€¢Work with existing web3 protocols, new web3 and web2 developers & institutions to empathize with pain points and interpret feature requests for new Ondo infrastructure

â€¢Maintain strong relationships with 3rd party partners ranging from web2 institutions to web3 DeFi protocols. Establish aligned incentives and KPIs and help unblock and escalate technical issues

  

 **Requirements:**

  

â€¢2+ years of full-time Developer Relations experience at an existing web3 protocol, L1 or L2

â€¢2+ years of full-time software engineering experience, preferably within web3. We might ask you to jump in to fix a bug or partner-related issue from time to time.

â€¢Excellent technical and non-technical communication skills, verbal and written. You should have published examples of developer blog posts, video tutorials or open-source contributions/discussions.

â€¢Based in PT, MT, CT, or ET time zones

â€¢Bachelor's degree or significant coursework in Computer Science, Engineering, or a related technical field

â€¢Familiarity with the Real-World Asset space and DeFi protocols

â€¢Familiarity with smart contract development, blockchain protocols, and blockchain virtual machines

â€¢Strong ownership mentality and ability to execute in fast-paced, ambiguous circumstances

  

 **Nice to haves:**

  

â€¢Familiarity with the Cosmos SDK and ecosystem tools

  

 **What we offer:**

  

â€¢Competitive compensation including salary, future token rights, and/or equity (according to your preferences) â€” we're well-funded and believe that great talent deserves great compensation.

â€¢Full benefits (medical, vision, and dental) and flexible vacation policy (PTO).

â€¢Small remote-first team across many countries â€” you'll be an early team member helping shape our vision, culture, and design practices.

â€¢A+ colleagues â€” our team includes alumni from: Goldman Sachs, Blackrock, Two Sigma, Bridgewater, SpaceX, AWS, Meta, Google, McKinsey, Circle, Uniswap.

â€¢Best-in-class investors â€” we are proud to be backed by leading crypto experts and VCs, including Pantera Capital, Founders Fund and Coinbase Ventures.
