About the team:

As we continue to prioritize US healthcare experience and domain expertise, this position will require continued strong working relationships with the Partnerships / Marketplace and Corporate Strategy teams. As we grow, this team will become slightly more hybrid with travel to Toronto. M&A has been and will continue to be a critical mechanism by which PointClickCare executes its strategy and long-term growth aspirations. Lastly, this is a small but high-impact team

  

About the role:

As we have now consolidated Strategy and Corporate Development under a single VP, we are looking for a self-starter capable of driving M&A forward in the day-to-day capacity. This role will have day-to-day ownership for M&A, from sourcing and diligence all the way through transaction execution and initial integration planning. PointClickCare has executed 7 acquisitions since 2018, or about 1 per year. These have ranged from customer acquisitions like AHT to bold, ambitious new-market entries with Collective Medical and Audacious Inquiry. As a company, we have a highly aspirational mission and vision and prioritize moving quickly; consequently, we will often conclude that acquisition is the fastest and most viable path for us to turn this mission and vision into a reality.
