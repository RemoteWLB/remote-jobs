## Description

 **What Weâ€™re Building**

Honeycomb is the observability platform for teams who manage software that matters. Send any data to our one-of-a-kind data store, solve problems with all the relevant context, and fix issues before your customers find them. Honeycomb is the unified, fast, and collaborative choice for engineering teams who care about customer experience to get the answers they need, quickly. We are passionate about consumer-quality developer tools and excited to build technology that raises our industryâ€™s expectations of what our tools can do for us. Weâ€™re working with well known companies like HelloFresh, Slack, LaunchDarkly, and Vanguard and more across a range of industries. This is an exciting time in our trajectory, as weâ€™ve closed Series D funding, scaled past the 200-person mark, and were named to Forbesâ€™ Americaâ€™s Best Startups of 2022 and 2023!

**Who We Are**

We come for the impact, and stay for the culture! Weâ€™re a talented, opinionated, passionate, fiercely inclusive, and responsible group of bees. We have conviction and we strive to live our values every day. We want our people to do what they truly love amongst a team of highly talented (but humble) peers.

**How We Work**

We are a remote-first company, which means we believe it is not where you sit, but how you deliver that matters most. We invest in our people and care about how you orient to our culture and processes. At the same time we imbue a lot of trust, autonomy, and accountability from Day 1. #LI-Remote

  

 **2025: The Year of AI at Honeycomb!**

Weâ€™re thrilled to announce the formation of our dedicated AI Team, a powerhouse of innovation and vision. This team will drive our AI strategy, crafting game-changing product features that span the spectrum of machine learning (ML) to generative AI (GenAI). Theyâ€™ll also elevate the engineering domain by building the frameworks that enable teams across Honeycomb to harness the power of AI effectively.

  

While AI isnâ€™t new territory for Honeycomb, this initiative marks an exciting leap forward as we scale our capabilities and impact. Want a peek at what weâ€™ve been up to? Dive into our blog posts to see the journey so far:
