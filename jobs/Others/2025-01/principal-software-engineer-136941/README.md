 **The Role**

As a **Principal Software Engineer** , you won't just codeâ€”you'll be an architect of systems, a mentor for teams, and a driving force in our mission. This is a role for builders, visionaries, and relentless problem solvers who refuse to settle for "good enough."

### What You'll Do:

*  **Architect Systems That Last:** Design and implement complex, distributed systems that balance scalability, reliability, and simplicity. You'll actively code and ensure the architecture isn't just theoretical but practical.
*  **Own the Journey:** Lead projects end-to-end, from discovery to delivery. You'll identify problems, create solutions, and ensure the team crosses the finish line.
*  **Drive Standards of Excellence:** Define what "good" looks like, enforce it through best practices, and mentor others to uphold it.
*  **Tackle the Hard Problems:** Dive into ambiguity, uncover clarity, and build solutions that stand the test of time.
*  **Mentor, Inspire, Lead:** Lift those around you by sharing your knowledge, conducting meaningful reviews, and guiding the next generation of engineers.
*  **Leverage AI and Automation:** Use the latest tools and technologies to supercharge productivity, streamline processes, and push boundaries in efficiency.

  

### Who You Are:

* You are not just a software engineerâ€”you're an innovator who thrives on turning complexity into simplicity. You're deeply technical, but your impact goes far beyond the codebase.
* 10+ years of hands-on software engineering, building distributed systems and solving high-scale challenges.
* Proven experience in technical leadership, shaping both architecture and the engineers around you.
* A "builder's mindset"â€”you're as comfortable creating solutions from scratch as you are refining existing systems.
* Relentless problem solver who thrives on ambiguity and complexity.
* Deep understanding of modern software architecture, from microservices to system design.
* Experience mentoring teams, leading by example, and fostering a culture of learning.
* Advanced proficiency in AI-driven tools and automation for software development.
* Advanced English skills to collaborate with our global team.

  

### What You Will Find Here:

*  **Impact at Scale:** Your work will directly affect millions of merchants.
*  **Freedom to Build:** We embrace creativity and experimentation. Take risks. Fail fast. Learn and iterate.
*  **A Culture of Excellence:** We are relentless about raising the bar, and we expect the same of you.
*  **Global Team, Shared Vision:** Join a diverse, talented group united by ambition and purpose.
*  **The Wolfpack:** At CloudWalk, you're not just an employeeâ€”you're part of a pack that has your back.
