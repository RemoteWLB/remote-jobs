Supabase Realtime is written in Elixir and manages broadcasting database updates to thousands of connected clients for Supabase customers.

Supabase Supavisor, also written in Elixir, handles thousands of database clients that run millions of queries using different SDKs. It’s an extremely performance focused product that handles low level APIs to connect to Postgres in the most effective ways, fully leveraging the features of Postgres and Elixir.

Supporting a global cluster of machines that have thousands of connected users sending thousands of messages per second or running thousands of queries per second presents several challenges and we need your help to tackle them. Join us for the next phase of growth.
