The Uniswap Labs team is building products to unlock value through universal exchange. We envision a future where digital economies flourish, and markets are transparent, global, and equitable.

Our products â€“ the Uniswap Interface, the Uniswap Mobile App, and the Uniswap Extension â€“ are powered by the Uniswap Protocol. The protocol is the largest onchain marketplace, with billions of dollars in weekly volume across thousands of tokens on Ethereum and 8+ additional chains. As part of our onchain journey, we recently launched an Optimism L2 chain that we want to scale and expand.

  * Design, build, and maintain a large-scale production system on the cloud, ensuring smooth operation and high availability.
  * Be part of the on-call rotation to guarantee the chain is running 24/7 without outages.
  * Provide guidance and technical leadership to peers in navigating architectural and coding tradeoffs. Help onboard new and existing members to the Unichain specifics.

**Requirements**

  * 5+ years of software engineering experience, including 2+ years of software engineering experience on EVM related chains.
  * Excellent coding skills, deep understanding of cloud architectures, algorithms, and strong debugging capabilities.
  * Experience building backend systems from the ground up, on a 0â†’1 fashion.
  * Desire to keep up with modern best practices in software development/Web3, and shape our tech stack as we build out new systems and services.
  * Experiencing mentoring junior engineers

**Nice to have:**

  * Experience with working on an Optimism chain either contributing to the OP code itself or a different rollup chain
  * Experience with Solidity
  * Prior experience with time-series based monitoring / observability systems
