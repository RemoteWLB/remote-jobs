# [Senior Fullstack Engineer](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/senior-fullstack-engineer-138550)  
### Biconomy  
####  

Biconomy empowers Web3 developers to build seamless, user-friendly dApps that work effortlessly across multiple blockchains. Our battle-tested modular account and execution stack eliminates traditional UX friction points, helping projects accelerate user adoption while reducing development costs. By processing over 50 million transactions across the 300+ dApps we've served, we're powering the future of onchain economies.  
  
 **The Role – Build the Protocol Powering the Future of Web3  
**

As a Senior Fullstack Engineer on our Modular Execution Environment (MEE) team, you’ll help architect and scale the MEE protocol – a modular execution layer for advanced blockchain operations designed to horizontally scale blockchains in a multi-chain world. This is not just application development – you’ll be building foundational infrastructure that underpins decentralized, cross-chain supertransactions and smart account interactions.  

You’ll work across the entire MEE stack:  

  *  **MEE Protocol** – Develop the decentralized network and cryptoeconomic systems, working on P2P communication, slashing mechanisms, and storage proofs.

  *  **MEE Network Infrastructure** – Build the foundational infrastructure, from bundlers to validators, supporting the MEE protocol’s decentralization roadmap.

  *  **Backend & Indexers** – Design complex systems to aggregate, index, and interpret on-chain and off-chain data, powering real-time cross-chain operations.

  *  **Implementing Supertransactions -** Develop and refine a novel data type that defines cross-chain operations (EVM and non-EVM). Supertransactions aggregate multiple on-chain and off-chain interactions into a Merkle tree, enabling seamless, complex multi-chain execution.

  
 **What You Will Be Doing:**

  *  **Protocol Development** – Contribute to core MEE protocol components, including slashing mechanisms, cryptoeconomic design, and validator infrastructure.

  *  **Infrastructure Design** – Build the backend infrastructure that facilitates MEE’s transition from centralized to fully decentralized P2P execution.

  *  **Indexers & Aggregation** – Develop and optimize indexing services that process and aggregate data across multiple blockchains into abstract supertransaction models.

  *  **Cross-Chain Execution** – Design systems to handle seamless cross-chain flows, enabling developers to execute complex, multi-chain transactions with minimal overhead.

  *  **Scalable Backend Systems** – Implement scalable microservices, APIs, and backend solutions to support high-throughput, low-latency blockchain interactions.

  *  **Collaborate on Cutting-Edge Tech** – Work with blockchain engineers, cryptographers, and product teams to integrate novel technologies like storage proofs, intent-based bridges, and gossip networks.

 **Requirements:**

  *  **Experience:** 3+ years of fullstack development with a focus on blockchain protocols, infrastructure, or decentralized networks.

  *  **Tech Stack:** Proficiency in JavaScript/TypeScript, Node.js and Web3 frameworks (Ethers.js, viem).

  *  **Blockchain Expertise:** Deep understanding in any of the following:

    *  **Account Abstraction (AA)**

    *  **4337 Bundlers**

    *  **Smart Accounts & EIP7702**

    *  **Storage Proofs** (e.g., Herodotus)

    *  **Intent-Based Bridges** (e.g., Across, Connext)

    *  **Cross-Chain Messaging** (e.g., Axelar, LayerZero)

    *  **Gossip Networks & P2P Systems**

    *  **Liquidity Fronting**

    *  **MEV, Flashbots & UserOps**

    *  **Merkle Trees, Sequencers & Rollups**

  *  **Backend Mastery:** Experience building high-performance, scalable infrastructure and working with decentralized architectures.

  *  **Collaborative Approach:** Proven ability to work cross-functionally across protocol, backend, and product teams in a fast-paced, iterative environment.  

  
 **Nice-to-Have:  
**

  * Contributions to open-source blockchain infrastructure projects.

  * Familiarity with optimistic rollups, zk-rollups, or modular execution environments.

  * Experience developing validators, bundlers, or sequencers in a P2P blockchain environment.

  * Understanding of MEV mitigation, frontrunning, and cross-chain arbitrage solutions.

  * Familiarity with Rust and/or Go

  
 **What We Offer:**

  *  **Flexible Working Hours** : Enjoy autonomy over your schedule.

  *  **Generous Vacation Policy** : 25 days vacation per year plus public holidays.

  *  **Competitive Salary** : With regular performance reviews.

  *  **Token Allocation** : Be rewarded with tokens as part of our compensation package.

  *  **Growth Opportunities** : Be part of an exciting new project with significant career growth potential.

  *  **Innovative Work Culture** : Join a team that’s at the cutting edge of Web3, AI, and DeFi, and help shape the future of the digital economy.

  *  **Fun and Engaging Team Activities** : Game nights, virtual celebrations, and work retreats to keep things exciting.
