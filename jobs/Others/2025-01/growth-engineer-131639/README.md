**About Cleo**

Most people come to Cleo to do work that matters. Every day, we fight for the worldâ€™s financial health, building a beloved AI that empowers people to make better financial decisions.

Backed by some of the most well-known investors in tech, weâ€™ve reached over 5 million users and plan to double that number each year...which is where you come in.

Weâ€™re looking for an awesome Web Engineer, with some knowledge of Ruby / Rails, to join us on our mission to fight for the world's financial health. Youâ€™ll be joining a cross-functional team of brilliant people that are looking to continuously improve the vitality of our product and get it into the hands of the people that need it most. We understand our customers, we understand their pain, and we are passionate about helping them.

### **What youâ€™ll be doing**

  * Joining a cross-functional Growth squad with a mix of marketers, designers, UX writers, data analysts and others to improve the reach of our product and help improve our usersâ€™ financial health.
  * Technical oversight of attribution touch points and distribution of events to 3rd parties, effectively utilising both our frontend (Typescript / React / React Native) and backend (Ruby / Rails) architecture.
  * Working with 3rd party platforms, such as:
    * Ad networks (e.g. Facebook, TikTok, Twitter, Google)
    * Affiliate networks (e.g. Rakuten)
    * Attribution platforms (e.g. AppsFlyer)
    * CRM (e.g. customer.io)
    * Web (e.g. WebFlow)
  * Collaboratively working with Marketing and Data teams to set up efficient attribution pipelines, allowing for fast testing & iteration.
  * Working closely with our SEO Lead, optimise our website for SEO to improve search engine rankings for highly competitive keywords and drive highly motivated new users to the site
  * Making informed delivery decisions based upon the overview of data being sent to / ingested from 3rd parties
  * Getting involved in cross-cutting concerns that lift our entire engineering effort with the rest of the frontend chapter.
  * Taking part in shaping all the work your squad does, not just the technical parts. Delivery is a team sport, and we encourage everyone at Cleo to share their ideas, so you can expect to be involved in product ideation sessions, user research calls, design reviews, retrospectives, ways of working sessions, product demos, OKR reviews.

Here are some examples, big and small, of the kinds of work our Growth squad have taken part in over the last year:

  * Integration with a new affiliate 3rd party provider, looping back in-app event data for accurate measurements  

  * To ensure we can monitor conversion rates, adding support for new ad platforms on our web and landing pages so they attribute correctly through to app install and sign up  

  * Working with Data and Marketing to run ROAS optimisation tests with various 3rd parties

Within our Growth squad, you will be iterating and delivering quickly to help us gain greater insight into our users' needs and seeing your work having a material impact on the financial health of those most in need.

### **About you**

Firstly, and most importantly, all of the above sounds exciting to you and you want to make a positive difference in society by improving the financial health of our users worldwide.

Youâ€™ve also read our company values and engineering principles which drive our ways of working and help us deliver working software to our users, learn what works and iterate quickly to improve it. You share and embrace these opinions and are passionate about using them to deliver value.

You will be the first Growth Engineer of hopefully many more to come. Being a pioneer in this area, you will have the opportunity to build and grow the future of Growth Engineering at Cleo.

For this Growth focused role, we also have some specific asks:

  * You are an experienced Growth Engineer that knows how to utilise experimentation, creativity and analysis to make an outsized impact.
  * Youâ€™re experienced working closely with marketing teams to optimise and develop innovative web flows.
  * You are self-driven; finding a balance between Making it Happen in the present and identifying best practice for future Growth Engineers to join and build upon your foundations.

  * **Work where you work best.** Weâ€™re a globally distributed team. If you live in London we have a hybrid approach, we encourage you to spend one day a week or more in our beautiful office but this is fully flexible.

**UK App access:** The Cleo app is no longer downloadable in the UK. If youâ€™re an existing user, youâ€™ll still have access to the app. But some features wonâ€™t be available (just for a little while). Why? 99% of our users are based in the US â€“ where financial health is often overlooked. Weâ€™ve decided to shift our focus to where we can provide the most value and make the greatest impact for users who need it most. Then weâ€™ll be able to apply what we learn to better support our UK users in the future.
