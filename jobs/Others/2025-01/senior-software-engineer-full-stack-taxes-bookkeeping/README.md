# **About Found**

The self-employed workforce is a rapidly growing, resilient, and colorful 60 million Americans. But self-employment comes with its own set of challenges: navigating taxes, accounting, bookkeeping, and business banking are just a few. Thatâ€™s where we come in.

Found is building tools that give self-employed people the security and peace of mind that has historically only been possible at big corporations. Weâ€™re a business bank account that automates taxes and expense tracking because we believe small business owners should spend more time doing what they love and less time on their business finances.
