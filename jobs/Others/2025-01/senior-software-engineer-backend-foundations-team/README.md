**Elevate Octopus Server with Your Expertise!**

  

This role is part of the Backend Foundations Team, which develops the building blocks of Octopus Server. Our customers are other internal teams that develop against Octopus Server, who choose to rely on these building blocks for simple, reliable and performant foundations.

  

We are looking for a **Senior Software Engineer** with experience in developing strong foundations that support software teams. Our current roadmap is focused on several areas including: improving observability with trace telemetry (OpenTelemetry); consolidating our work abstractions; tightening feedback loops for engineers (improving build times); further exploring the modularity of our monolithic architecture and supporting patterns and guidance, so teams fall into the pit of success easily.

  

If you are excited by challenges like improving testing techniques and tightening feedback loops, we want you on our team!

* You enjoy working in a "you built it, you run it" culture, where teams take pride in the quality of their work and the availability of their systems, with many people joining our humane on-call program.
* You can work independently, motivating yourself to do high-quality work on time and communicating with your teammates when you need help or are ready for something new.
* You enjoy collaborating with other people to solve problems, challenging each other to discover the best solution for a problem using a balance of passion, pragmatism, and empathy.
* You are a results-oriented person, focused on iteratively delivering valuable things to your customers, willingly changing direction based on clear and transparent business information, and someone who helps others do the same.

  

### You'll Enjoy This Role If:

### A typical day might include:

* Working where you work best, in a home office designed by you, using a device of your choosing, with or without music, in an atmosphere you create for yourself.
* Changing source code hosted in GitHub, most of it in the open, collaborating on a pull request, then shipping a release to customers worldwide via an automated build, test, and delivery pipeline, often within the same day.
* Handling an inbound support ticket from a customer, helping them succeed with Octopus, or offering advice to a customer in our community Slack workspace.
* Pairing with another software engineer or a support engineer to help them reproduce a tricky problem, helping them understand the inner workings of Octopus in the process so they can be more helpful to even more customers over time.
* Pairing with another engineer on a Zoom call to solve a complex technical problem or design a new feature.
* Fixing a bug using an approach like red-green-refactor to prevent customers from experiencing that bug again.
* Improving our documentation to help customers discover solutions for themselves and learn how to use Octopus for more complicated workflows.
