## Description

 **About Us:**

Verifiable provides industry-leading, API-first solutions to automate credentialing and provider network management for the healthcare industry. Our software is used by some of the largest and fastest growing healthcare companies like Humana, TriWest, Spring Health, Modern Health, Talkspace and Grow Therapy. We are an official Salesforce vendor, and the #1 fastest-growing ISV partner on the Salesforce app exchange in 2023.

  

About our tech stack:

  

The platform API is built using the most recent version of .NET using serverless and managed infrastructure. It is designed using RESTful best practices and consumed directly by our customers, in addition to our user interfaces on the web or on Salesforce. Our user interfaces are completely stateless and do not have any server side processing. All of the functionality and business logic is made available through the same API that can also be directly consumed by our customers. The API is containerized and hosted in AWS using Fargate. Work is offloaded using a message queue to our worker cluster. We use Aurora as our structured data store.

  

About You:

  

As a software engineer on our API team, youâ€™ll contribute to the development, scaling, and maintenance of our API platform. You have an eye for detail and take pride in writing clean, maintainable code. Youâ€™re eager to learn and grow while contributing to the teamâ€™s success, balancing the need for high-quality software with the realities of delivering value to the business. You thrive on solving problems, breaking them down into manageable pieces, and working collaboratively with others to build effective solutions. You're open to feedback and strive to continuously improve your skills while supporting your teammates to do the same.
