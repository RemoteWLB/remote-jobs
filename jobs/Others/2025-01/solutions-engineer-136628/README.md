**What do we do?**

Paddle offers SaaS companies a completely different approach to their payment infrastructure. Instead of assembling and maintaining a complex stack of payments-related apps and services, weâ€™re a Merchant of Record for our customers. That means we take away 100% of the pain of payment fragmentation. Itâ€™s faster, safer, cheaper, and, above all, way better.

Weâ€™re backed by investors including KKR, FTV Capital, Kindred, Notion, and 83North and serve over 3000 software sellers in 245 territories globally.

**The Role:**

 **We are looking for a smart, entrepreneurial and autonomous Solutions Architect to help us achieve our ambitious growth plans. This is an exciting time for you to join- youâ€™ll be part of an established and high performing team in EMEA.**

Working as an expert within our Sales team, you'll use your skills in technical consulting and project management to enable leading software vendors to build incredible customer experiences with Paddle and assist them in overcoming any technical challenges along the way.

As a member of the team, youâ€™ll provide white glove treatment to our largest US accounts, working collaboratively across Sales, Success & Product.

**What you'll do:**

  * Become an expert on the Paddle product suite, including the checkout, dashboard, and APIs

  * Communicate confidently with C-suite and senior developers to support them in building incredible experiences for their customers

  * Write integration plans and sample code for sellers to assist them in implementing their own Paddle integration

  * Support and empower Account Executives on customer calls to help win new business

  * Play a role in product development, by communicating issues and feature requests to the Product and Engineering teams

  * Contribute to public and internal documentation

 **We'd love to hear from you:**

  * You have great web technologies experience including HTML, CSS and JavaScript and an understanding of how the technologies work together.

  * You have experience using and integrating APIs.

  * You have strong interpersonal and customer management skills that you developed in a customer-facing role.

  * You have the ability to discuss technical concepts with both technical and non-technical audiences.

  * You understand the online payments infrastructure, ideally with experience within this world.

 **Everyone is welcome at Paddle**

At Paddle, weâ€™re committed to removing invisible barriers, both for our customers and within our own teams. We recognise and celebrate that every Paddler is unique and we welcome every individual perspective. As an inclusive employer, we donâ€™t care if, or where, you studied, what you look like or where youâ€™re from. Weâ€™re more interested in your craft, curiosity, passion for learning and what youâ€™ll add to our culture. We encourage you to apply even if you donâ€™t match every part of the job ad, especially if youâ€™re part of an underrepresented group.  
  
**Please let us know if thereâ€™s anything we can do to better support you through the application process and in the workplace. We will do everything we can to support any accommodations needed.** Weâ€™re committed to building a diverse team where everyone feels safe to be their authentic self. Letâ€™s grow together.
