### G2i Inc.  
####  

Hi! We're Strategy11. We are the company behind Formidable Forms, WP Tasty, and Business Directory Plugin. No matter what product we're working on, our goal is to make big projects possible without big resources, and make complex tasks simple. Our software is running on nearly 400,000 websites, and our team is growing fast. We have tons of big plans for the future, and would love for you to be a part of it.

As a Software Engineer, you're responsible for running Business Directory Plugin and AWP Classifieds. You will plan the roadmap, build new features, improve existing code, squash bugs, and work together with the Customer Success and Growth teams.

We are looking for energetic and fun people who love to work hard and get things done.  

 **To love this role, here’s the type of person you are:**

  * You’re a self-starter who loves taking initiative and seeing things through from conception to completion. You will "own" these products and are responsible for prioritizing, scoping, development, and testing.

  * You're an excellent communicator, fluent in both verbal and written English, who makes sure nothing slips through the cracks. We believe communication is critical and there is no such thing as over communicating.

  * You have the curiosity and desire to learn and grow your skills.

  * You are skilled at managing your personal workload, project timelines, and deliverables with a high degree of autonomy, ensuring that development goals are met efficiently.

  * You have expert knowledge to prioritize and balance new features, bugs, and maintenance.

  * You're passionate about leaving your mark on the web for all to see and are excited to work on tasks that impact thousands of users.

  * You take pride in the quality and craftsmanship of your work rather than just doing it to get it done.

  * You're a team player who is comfortable working alongside and helping other team members, and you don't take critical feedback personally.

  * You're happy jumping between front-end and back-end development tasks, or tackling tasks which require both.

  * You're happy working on tasks of all sizes - from small bug fixes and enhancements to large features/rewrites.

  * You enjoy coordinating with other teams, but are perfectly happy working alone.  

 **Common responsibilities include (but are not limited to):**

  * Develop and maintain a clear product roadmap, outlining future features, improvements, and maintenance plans in alignment with business goals.

  * Prioritize product initiatives based on impact, resources, and timelines.

  * Collaborate closely with a designer to conceptualize new features and enhancements, ensuring that they align with user needs and product vision.

  * Execute the end-to-end development process, from ideation through deployment, ensuring high-quality standards in coding and testing.

  * Take full ownership of the development lifecycle for all new features, from initial coding through to deployment, adhering to high standards of quality and performance.

  * Actively manage a bug tracking system, prioritizing and resolving issues efficiently to maintain a seamless user experience.

  * Refactoring legacy code with a particular attention to backwards compatibility.

  * When tickets are escalated, debug customer issues in our help desk.

  * Monitor market trends and competitor activities, adjusting the product strategy to stay competitive and meet evolving user needs.

  * Provide technical insights and product knowledge to support the creation of marketing materials, playing a hands-on role in the execution of marketing initiatives.  

 **Here are some skills that will come handy:**

  * Excellent time management and organizational skills, with the capability to juggle multiple priorities simultaneously.

  * Strong problem-solving skills and the ability to work independently on complex projects.

  * Demonstrated ability in product management, including strategy formulation and roadmap execution.

  * Professional experience with WordPress plugin development, architecture, and standards.

  * Advanced proficiency with PHP and MySQL, including modern PHP practices (OOP, autoloading, traits, interfaces, etc).

  * Strong familiarity with JavasScript (vanilla JS, jQuery, etc).

  * Ability to use and extend build tools like webpack.

  * Familiarity with package managers such as NPM.

  * Experience working with third-party APIs (Eg Stripe, Mailchimp, etc).

  * Competent with version control through git and GitHub.

  * The ability to iterate and ship ideas quickly.

  * Exceptional troubleshooting skills.

  * Ability to keep complex ideas and features simple. (Simplicity is a core value!)

  * Previous freelance or remote work experience.  

 **Bonus points if you also have:**

  * Advanced proficiency in JavaScript frameworks like VueJS or React.

  * Experience with e-commerce platforms or related APIs (WooCommerce, Stripe, PayPal, etc).

  * Experience with DevOps or infrastructure management.
