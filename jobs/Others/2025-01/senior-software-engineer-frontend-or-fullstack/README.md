#  **TL;dr:**

We have 10 open engineering roles with an industry leader in crypto with 3 billion in revenue. The team is 30 people strong with a true remote first culture. We at G2i placed the senior engineering manager in this company 6 years ago and he came back to us to help his team grow! You must be product minded and sweat the small stuff when it comes to user experience. If you have a high degree of ownership as an engineer you'll be a good fit. If you have experience with growth, memberships, subscriptions (eg. doordash, instacart) that is a huge bonus. We'll want to know more about your super power as an engineer. What are you best at? The team is looking for engineers that aren't just going to pass the tech interviews, but will actually help the team level up as a whole.

This specific role is unique because you are bringing a service on chain. You _must_ be a Web 3 obsessed engineer. You love everything about crypto, dAPP’s etc. You live and breath this world. You'll have to a 0 to 1 engineer as well. There is no roadmap and you are figuring things out as you go along. You'll help create the roadmap! Essentially you are building a startup within an established org.

 **Tech Stack:** This role require at least 5 years of overall experience. You can be frontend focused OR fullstack focused, either is fine. React is a must. TypeScript and React Native are nice to haves. You'll be working across web and mobile (using RN). Knowledge of Relay and GraphQL are also nice to haves. If you are fullstack, you'll need to have Go experience in addition to React. We also have roles open that require less experience (links here: frontend/backend).

 **Location:** Fully remote. US or Canada. For truly exceptional candidates we'll consider locations in LATAM and Europe.
