## Description

WHO ARE YOU

You have a solid experience designing and implementing effective solutions with different technologies. You strive to understand the needs of customers, perfecting them and making a detailed design to develop the required functionalities. You provide advanced knowledge in programming practices and continuous integration processes, which will be at the service of the team, encouraging collaboration with your colleagues, actively listening and valuing diversity in points of view as key skills to reach agreements from assertiveness and responsibility. You are curious and open to continuous learning staying up to date with new technologies.

  

THE OPPORTUNITY

WatchGuard Threat Hunting solution helps organizations to change their security posture from defensive to offensive, and to reduce investigation time, allowing analysts to swiftly correlate events and to test hypotheses. This solution speeds up incident response and the search for malwareless threats based on scalable behavioural analysis from the cloud.

This is the analytic component of the WatchGuard platform that gathers, enriches and filters millions of events. Hundreds of algorithms and analytics rules are applied, along with threat intelligence, in search of suspicious or malicious behaviours, in real time and retrospectively for 365 days.

Its tools, work consoles and pre-constructed analytics, such as the Threat Hunting library and JupyterLab Notebooks, allow effective searches for threats, accelerated investigations, and immediate actions on endpoints, from the very first day.

  

As a senior developer of the team your main responsibilities will be to work on the entire product development process, from design to development, provide your knowledge for the decision of evolutions and modifications from a clean code prism, the resolution of the various problems that may arise during programming and automation of cloud deployments.

Your professional maturity will allow you to be autonomous in the performance of your duties, so you will lead projects to achieve objectives, defining and implementing the steps to meet them within the established deadlines and following the quality standards that characterize our brand. You will have a constructive spirit with an attitude of wanting to learn and demonstrate what you have learned. You will show strong time organization skills, finding the most efficient way to accomplish tasks according to the given schedule, being careful and detailed. As the ultimate owners of the software we develop, we take care of it once deployed on the cloud, so you will actively participate in resolving incidents, identifying problems and proposing solutions to solve them.

  

You will be part of a high-performance team with extensive experience in the development of software solutions, working perfectly coordinated, enjoying the successes achieved and providing support when necessary. For this reason, we want to incorporate an extremely motivated, committed person, with a great capacity for adaptation and results-oriented, who must take advantage of all technological resources, for the design and development of effective and high performance solutions. We count on you to open doors to opportunities and constantly exceed goals and expectations. Hereâ€™s what that will look like:

  

Within a month, you willâ€¦

Manage the team's tools, systems, methods, and ways of working that allow you to communicate seamlessly with team members.

Solve your first user stories together with a colleague. This way, you will acquire knowledge of the different parts of the solution in a dynamic and active way, adding value from the very beginning.

Receive training that allows you to contribute ideas to improve our internal processes.

  

Within 3 months, you willâ€¦

Review user stories led by other people on the team, which will help you learn about established procedures and workflows.

Participate in the resolution of incidents in a collaborative and guided way, which will allow you to establish the knowledge acquired and be able to propose ideas for the improvement of processes.

  

Within 6 months, you will:

Successfully lead your own tasks, actively participating in the definition and estimation of others. Meet the expected delivery dates and keep the team informed of possible delays, helping to establish the necessary actions to achieve their execution.

Participate in the definition and review of standards and methodologies applicable to the design and implementation of code, helping to unify software development.

Detect opportunities to include them in the continuous improvement system.

  

A DAY IN THE LIFE

Each day you will participate with the team, in a daily meeting to review the key priorities of the day, indicating what was completed the previous day, what remains to be addressed, and if there is any impediment to its achievement. You will focus on your tasks, setting times throughout the day to take breaks to help you relax, unwind and recharge. You will communicate with your manager constantly, giving feedback on the status of your tasks, as well as the difficulties that may be encountered. You will request and provide support to other team members, scheduling meetings so as not to interrupt moments of concentration.

  

Every 2 weeks, you will participate in an estimation meeting with the Product Owner and the rest of the team, where new user stories will be presented and they will be estimated for the next sprints. You will show the Watchguard team and the rest of the teams the tasks you have achieved, solving any doubts that may arise during it.

  

You will participate in a retrospective meeting with the rest of the team, analyzing the work of the previous weeks, sharing what you think has worked and should be maintained, as well as what should be improved, proposing ideas or actions to achieve it.

  

You will spend time researching or training in interesting technologies for the growth of the platform, such as designing and implementing processes that automate or improve procedures, eliminating repetitive tasks that facilitate the daily work of the team.

  

Technologies of interest:

.NET Core, Entity Framework Core, Development of unit/integration/functional and authorization tests, Microsoft SQL Server, Test-oriented development, Microsoft Windows Azure (App services, App insights, ARM, Storage...), Vue.js, Python, JupyterLab notebooks.
