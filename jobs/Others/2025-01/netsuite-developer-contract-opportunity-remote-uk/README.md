## Description

Octopus Energy has grown exponentially in its short history. It is now a complex multi-billion turnover international group, which participates in multiple industry verticals including retail utilities, utilities management, generation, EV leasing and software sales.

  

We are committed to innovation, sustainability, and customer satisfaction. As part of our growth strategy, we are implementing NetSuite to streamline our finance operations and improve efficiency. We are seeking a NetSuite Developer to play a key role in this initiative.

  

Its legacy business management applications are at the limit of their capacity and capability. A new enterprise resource planning tool (ERP) is required to both provide a finance back bone for the Group, and to integrate information flows and insights across the group. Oracleâ€™s NetSuite SAAS platform has been selected for this task.

  

Working in Octopusâ€™ Finance Systems team, you will be responsible for building technical customizations and supporting integrations in NetSuite. NetSuite is our core Finance system and it is supplemented by additional applications focused on specific tasks performed or managed by the Finance team. NetSuite is not the only system in the Finance landscape and thus close coordination and integration with other teams and tools is very frequent.

  

This role will be pivotal in ensuring the ongoing success of NetSuite for the Group and is key to maintaining appropriate systems controls that reflect the Groupâ€™s segregation of duties.
