Thanks for your interest in Oklo! We are searching for an additional Regulatory Engineer to join our fuel recycling team.

## **Position Description:**

The Regulatory Engineer is responsible for both navigating the regulatory framework for licensing recycling and fuel fabrication facilities, as well as for participating in the engineering design of those same technologies. From a regulatory and licensing perspective, the Licensing Engineer is expected to develop an in-depth knowledge of relevant Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Environmental Protection Agency requirements, with an appreciation for the Oklo philosophy to approaching complex regulatory challenges. Specific work areas will be determined by experience, background, and interest. Oklo is undertaking revolutionary work in the licensing and deployment of modern fuel recycling facilities; we are seeking success-motivated individuals who want to play a key role in bringing that mission to a reality!

### **Specific responsibilities may include:**

Responsibilities will differ depending on your background:

  * Research and interpret regulations and regulatory precedents

  * Generate, refine, and review licensing documentation

  * Support managing deliverables for a variety of internal and external regulatory activities

  * Interface with technical staff, including reviewing technical material

  * Analyze regulatory documents and identify key aspects

  * Contribute to technical reports for issue to the regulator and to other outside bodies

  * Perform some design engineering work: provide technical feedback to quick-iterating design teams; document work using modern tools and techniques; and write well-written, thoughtful, technical reports

### **Competencies:**

We are looking for a Regulatory Engineer that is:

  * Passionate about clean energy, the environment, the recycling of nuclear fuel, and making advanced fission a reality

  * Willing and able to learn quickly, think differently, and do things in new ways

  * Eager to work on a dynamic team, identify when to pivot, and grow with us

  * Comfortable in a fast-paced, highly iterative startup environment

  * Excited to think creatively, critically, and reflectively about the problems they are solving, while not leaning only on what has been done before

  * An excellent writer who can write in modern active voice, so make your cover letter compelling and write it well!

### **Minimum Qualifications:**

  * Experience generating, contributing-to, or evaluating NRC license applications or amendments

  * Experience in a technical field

### **Bonus Qualifications:**

  * Experience with fuel fabrication or fuel cycle facilities, in either the commercial or DOE spaces

**Who you are:**

A startup person: You aren't driven by titles or hierarchy, and prefer efficiency to excess process. You don't need or expect to have a lot of guidance but you enjoy working in a fast-paced team. If you prefer the culture and feel of a large organization, that is great, but you likely won‚Äôt enjoy working with us! There is plenty of important work and plenty of good opportunities with organizations like that.

_Motivated_ : You are self-motivated. You bring an enthusiasm to the team, and imbue a sense of passion that goes beyond clocking in and clocking out. This isn‚Äôt about a fake or arbitrary ‚Äúpieces of flair‚Äù mentality or lack of work-life balance! It is about being a part of the vision and feeling a part of reaching team goals.

_A team-player_ : Oklo genuinely is a team. We aren‚Äôt about taking credit for ourselves, and we aren‚Äôt about pushing blame to others. We do incredible things because we work as a team.

_An excellent communicator_ : We need a person who is not only technically competent but also a clear and upbeat communicator.

_Creative_ : Being creative means that when things fall outside clear scopes or processes or problems arise without clear solutions, you are able to identify it as well as invent ways to solve a problem or fill a need without micromanagement. The successful person in this job will not only be creative, but also enjoy being creative and solving open-ended problems which may change day-by-day.

_Detail-oriented_ : This focus is a big part of excellence, consistency, and quality. Excellent grammar and spelling matter for both good communication as well as the image of the company that we put forward.

**About Oklo compensation:**

Salary: $85,000-$175,000

Oklo offers flexible time off, equity, competitive pay, 401k, health insurance, FSA, flexible work hours, and other benefits.
