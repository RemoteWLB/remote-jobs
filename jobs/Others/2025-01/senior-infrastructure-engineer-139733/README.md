At Eppo, we are building the future of experimentation, so that every company can have an entrepreneurial, customer oriented culture. We believe that AB experiments uniquely put customers at the center of product decisions instead of political processes.

Our next-gen platform allows companies to 10x their volume of AB experiments by embracing the full technical rigor of engineering and statistics while focusing intensely on the evangelism of results and accessibility to business users. We are built for the modern cloud infrastructure, with easy integrations and an emphasis on privacy and security.

Our team is made up of veteran product builders from Airbnb, Slack, and Snowflake, and our product is powering experimentation at some of top companies around the world. We’ve raised over $47M funding backed by top-tier venture firms like Innovation Endeavors, Icon Ventures, Menlo VC, and Amplify Partners. See our Series B announcement here.

## **About the Role**

As an Infrastructure Engineer, you will be the driving force behind our cloud architecture and systems reliability. You’ll own and optimize our Google Cloud Platform (GCP) resources, ensuring our infrastructure remains secure, scalable, and cost-effective. You will also be responsible for improving developer productivity by optimizing our local development environments and establishing best-in-class CI/CD pipelines.

Additionally, you will collaborate with product and data engineering teams to provide guidance on observability, performance, and scalability best practices, while ensuring our Kubernetes deployments are streamlined and resilient. In this role, you’ll help expand our platform to run in environments beyond GCP, taking on confidential projects and integrating infrastructure-as-code principles (Terraform) to deliver and maintain infrastructure solutions that support our growing product suite.

## Your Background

We’re looking for someone who combines deep technical expertise with a passion for building reliable, scalable systems from the ground up. As one of the first members of our infrastructure team, you’ll play a pivotal role in shaping its vision, driving best practices across the organization, and mentoring fellow engineers. You thrive in a fast-paced environment, enjoy tackling complex infrastructure challenges, and are eager to take ownership of core systems that power our growing product suite.

Here are some of the skills and attributes we are looking for:

## Skills

  * **Cloud Expertise** : Hands-on experience with Google Cloud Platform (or other major cloud providers), including resource management, cost optimization, and security.

  *  **Programming & Scripting**: Comfort writing automation scripts (e.g., Bash, Python, Go) to streamline infrastructure tasks and improve efficiency.

  *  **Containers & Orchestration**: Proficiency with Docker and Kubernetes (including local development tools such as Docker Compose, Minikube, or K3s).

  *  **Infrastructure as Code** : Experience with Terraform (or similar IaC tools) to deploy and maintain complex infrastructure in a repeatable, scalable manner.

  *  **Scalability & Observability**: Familiarity with monitoring, logging, and alerting best practices, ensuring systems are both observable and scalable.

  *  **Performance Tuning** : Familiarity with load testing, performance profiling, and capacity planning to ensure systems remain responsive under growing demand.

  *  **CI/CD and Automation** : Proven track record of designing and implementing continuous integration and deployment pipelines that boost developer productivity.

  *  **Networking & Security**: Solid grasp of core networking concepts (DNS, routing, load balancing) and a track record of securing systems at scale (e.g., IAM, SSL, firewalls).

  *  **Security Mindset** : Comfort implementing security measures and best practices to protect sensitive data and systems.

  *  **Collaboration & Leadership**: Excellent communication and the ability to work cross-functionally, guiding both product and data engineering teams on infrastructure and performance decisions.

## Attributes

  * Startup mindset: You are comfortable making choices in ambiguous situations, and think of the team's success and failure as your own.

  * Dependable: We don't know what odd situations will come down the pike, both in our data pipelines and as a company. You will know how to build reliable systems so customers trust our data and trust us.

  * Optimizer: We operate on very high scale data systems. You will design and build software that needs to be reliable and performant at scale.

  * Leader: Willing to raise your hand and take ownership over code and systems

At Eppo, we are committed to creating an equitable and inclusive workplace, offering competitive compensation, and fostering a culture that encourages entrepreneurship and growth. The typical compensation for this role ranges from $180,000-$190,000

 **This is a remote role; however, candidates located in the New York City metro area are highly preferred.**
