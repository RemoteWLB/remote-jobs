Secfix helps small and medium businesses become and stay compliant to security frameworks like ISO 27001, GDPR, TISAX, and SOC 2 in weeks instead of months.

Today over 1.78 million of small and medium-sized businesses in Europe alone need to be compliant with information security frameworks to be able to sell their products and services to larger enterprise customers.

Secfix integrates with a company’s tech stack (like AWS, Azure AD, Jira, etc.), automatically extracts the data needed for compliance, and creates a checklist the company can follow to become and remain compliant.

 **Why should you join Secfix?**

Secfix is an early-stage fully remote startup in the best sense of the word. We’re a fun, close-knit team on a mission to automate security and compliance for modern companies and become the European compliance automation leader. We rapidly grew from just three founders to 20 people in less than 2 years after founding.

Your work will significantly impact our tech product used by CTOs, engineering teams, COOs and the whole team will celebrate your wins.

In comparison to many startups we are growing the team at a healthy rate and there is a balance between fast growth and maintaining our runway as we scale. Most of our costs are already covered by revenue.

With new challenges (we're looking to 2x the team next year), you're assured of growth and progress. Our trajectory is fueled by top investors, including Octopus Ventures, Neosfer (Commerzbank), founders of Signavio and many more angels.

 **Who are we looking for?**

We're building an environment at Secfix where ambitious, independent engineers can thrive. We want to grow with people who take pride on building and maintaining actual products, who are curious about how the features we ship are used daily to solve real challenges, and who'll use their in-depth engineering insights to push the envelope on what we can achieve together. We own products and outcomes, not Jira tickets.

Bring your commitment and drive to grow, and we’ll deliver an environment that keeps you happy, healthy, and empowered to do your best work with us.

Scope of this role: 90% backend troubleshooting, 10% new feature development.

 **Experience that you will ideally bring**

  * 1+ years of experience in Backend Engineering through first full-time job and internships.

  * Solid foundation in object-oriented programming with Java.

  * First professional production experience in Java Spring Boot, Hibernate, and SQL.

  * You thrive when you have autonomy, own as many of the details as possible, and project manage your own work.

You **should not apply** if:

  * You need a lot of processes to tell you what to do or you're comfortable only picking up highly detailed tickets from a JIRA board

  * You don’t want to test, deploy, monitor and troubleshoot your own code

  * You’ll collaborate and grow: Work with a talented and supportive team to analyze root causes, design solutions, and improve our backend systems.

  * You’ll contribute to new features: Occasionally work on feature development as the team and product expand.

    * We are obsessed with our customers.

    * We build smart.

    * We create trust
