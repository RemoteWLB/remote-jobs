## Description

mabl is on a mission to empower software teams with an AI-powered low-code test automation platform that streamlines testing across web, mobile, API, accessibility, and performance. We enable everyone from global enterprises to fast-growing startups to integrate application testing into their development pipelines, accelerating their testing and boosting release cycles, regardless of technical experience.

  

In 2024, mabl was awarded its 5th AI Breakthrough Award, cementing its position as the #1 AI-powered testing platform in the world. While we continue to grow with the pace of technology, we also believe strongly in the value of culture (our most recent internal survey shows that 92% of our employees feel supported by the flexibility of their work, and 97% believe their manager genuinely cares about their wellbeing.)

  

To continue delivering on our mission of transforming the testing space, weâ€™re looking for people to join our team of leaders, experts, innovators, and community builders. Our core values are: drive, authenticity, support, and insight; these are the foundation of our culture and a key part of what it means to be a mabler. We practice transparency, embrace collaboration, and lead with empathy while encouraging each other to bring our most authentic selves to work.

  

 **The Role**

  

You will work as a key member of our world-class engineering team, building systems that make it nearly effortless for customers--from startups to enterprise-scale organizations--to assess, manage, and improve software quality. More specifically, you will contribute to systems that enable customers to drive quality for native mobile iOS and Android applications. These cloud-hosted systems, built on modern frameworks and generative AI, use a combination of mobile testing tools and mabl's sophisticated test automation intelligence to support low-code test creation and highly-parallelized test executions. You will have a direct impact on mabl's business, customers, and culture.
