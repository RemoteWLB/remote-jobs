# [Senior Software Engineer](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/senior-software-engineer-139248)  
### G2i Inc.  
####  

We operate like a startup that already has a massive base of clients, so we have strong intuitions on what to build to create a software-powered law firm that will enable us to provide the best experience to our legal clients and unlock further scale. That includes both client-facing applications across a range of claim types (e.g., client communication portal) and internal applications that enhance how our legal staff operate (e.g., medical record review tooling and automation).We have built and launched (to a small set of users) an MVP of our client-facing web app for ongoing client communications and interactions. Current priorities include 1) deploying a version of that portal for a new, rapidly growing case type in the UK, 2) a record review application to power our team of record review analysts, and 3) integrating a payments solution for client disbursements.We are seeking a Senior Software Engineer to continue and accelerate the development of our client portal, envision
creative new features, and begin development of additional projects on our roadmap.

You’ll be a great fit for this role if you are passionate about building great UX, want to take all your technical experience and apply it to a green field domain, and would be excited to be an early team member of a nascent group that will grow into a significant part of the wider law firm.Existing Tech Stack:  
Ruby on Rails, Postgres, Tailwind CSS, Hotwire, Svelte, Heroku.

Here **’s what you’ll do:**  
\- Architect, design, develop, and maintain high-quality, scalable, and secure web application using modern web technologies;  
\- Collaborate with Product Manager and Lead Engineer to develop and execute the product roadmap;  
\- Own feature development from design through deployment and into operation, shipping often to get actionable feedback from the team and users;  
\- Help lead and scale the Engineering team. Establish culture, norms and best practices;  
\- Work on and oversee all parts of the system, including backend, frontend, and dev-ops.

 **What we’re looking for:**  
\- 7+ years experience in software development, including work on a consumer facing app with tens of thousands of users  
\- Extensive experience with Ruby on Rails  
\- Experience with React, Svelte, Vue, or another component-based JavaScript framework  
\- Expertise in designing and building cloud-native architectures on Heroku (or similar)  
\- Strong API integration experience  
\- Passion to create truly delightful experiences

This is what we believe it's important for the role:

  * Deep Ruby on Rails Experience

  * React/Vue fullstack experience (they'll work with Svelte, but they can easily pick it up if they know React or Vue)

  * Cloud experience, setting up CD etc, with AWS or GCP (they'd work with Heroku but it's harder to find people with Heroku experience so if they know AWS or GCP it should transfer well to Heroku)

In a nutshell they should be someone with experience with prodcut development as a whole not just frontend or backend dev, maybe they've joined a startup as a founding engineer or joined a small startup as they were scaling and were responsible for many things inside product dev.
