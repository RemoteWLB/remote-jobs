## Description

About Toku

At Toku, we are a high-tech global compensation and employment platform, offering the unique capabilities of real-time tax calculations, unified global API for employment solutions, and seamless ability to process non-cash compensation such as stock or token grants.

  

As a result, Toku has become a fundamental partner for crypto companies and their law firms for token generation events (TGE) and launches. Our newest flagship product â€” Token Grant Administration (TGA), a token cap table management/system of record for every token for every founder, employee, investor, went from product launch in October to billions of dollars in on-platform value.

  

Toku raised $20 million from a consortium led by Blockchain Capital with Protocol Labs, GMJP, OrangeDAO, Orrick, Reverie, Quantstamp, Next Web Capital, and prominent angel investors including Protocol Labs founder Juan Benet and Alchemy co-founders Nikil Viswanathan and Joe Lau.
