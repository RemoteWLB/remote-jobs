Abridge was founded in 2018 with the mission of powering deeper understanding in healthcare. Our AI-powered platform was purpose-built for medical conversations, improving clinical documentation efficiencies while enabling clinicians to focus on what matters most—their patients.

Our enterprise-grade technology transforms patient-clinician conversations into structured clinical notes in real-time, with deep EMR integrations. Powered by Linked Evidence and our purpose-built, auditable AI, we are the only company that maps AI-generated summaries to ground truth, helping providers quickly trust and verify the output. As pioneers in generative AI for healthcare, we are setting the industry standards for the responsible deployment of AI across health systems.

We are a growing team of practicing MDs, AI scientists, PhDs, creatives, technologists, and engineers working together to empower people and make care make more sense.

##  **The Role**

We’re looking for Staff & Senior Full Stack Software Engineers to join our growing Product Engineering team! You’ll play a key role in helping us scale and mature our business by building and supporting new + existing web applications and their supporting backends.

##  **What You'll Do**

  * Design, build, and support the robust cloud-based services we need for our rapidly-growing business

  * Make and implement technology decisions that support business needs without compromising security, privacy, or quality

  * Research commercial and open-source solutions, and make build vs buy recommendations to bring new capabilities into the technology organization. You’ll have a say in the technology strategy — not just implementation details

  * Advocate for high standards; make quality-of-life improvements to the codebase; and help limit the growth of technical debt 

  * Build deep user empathy and maintain a user-centric mindset

  * 5+ years of experience building, shipping, and operating cloud-based distributed systems at scale - You’ve seen what works, and probably a few things that didn’t work. Your opinions are grounded in experience

  * Experience as a lead engineer on a number of major components or subsystems of a software platform, or have been the lead for the platform itself

  * Confidence knowing your way around event pipelines and experience with tools such as Kinesis or Kafka

  * Several years of experience building software for a regulated environment, and understand the tradeoffs that can be required to ensure compliance with regulations and frameworks such as HIPAA, SOC 2, and HITRUST

##  **Life at Abridge**

At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.

Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.

##  **Diversity & Inclusion**

Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).

##  **Staying Safe - Protect Yourself From Recruitment Fraud**

We are aware of individuals and entities fraudulently representing themselves as Abridge recruiters and/or hiring managers. Abridge will never ask for financial information or payment, or for personal information such as bank account number or social security number during the job application or interview process.
