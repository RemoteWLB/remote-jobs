## Description

 **If you have fallen and risen, if you have broken and fixed, if you have dreamt and built, then you have grit. Then we speak the same language. Welcome to the Wolfpack.**

As a member of the engineering team, you are expected to have a high bar for the quality of code and the quality of user experience. Due to the nature of our business, candidates with the ability to handle multiple projects with changing priorities will thrive at CloudWalk.
