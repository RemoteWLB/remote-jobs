#### `ðŸŒŽ remote,Remote`  

## Description

Proof is the world's first identity-assured transaction management platform and we are on a mission to digitize trust for all of lifeâ€™s most critical transactions. Developed by the same market leaders and experts who brought notarization online with Notarizeâ„ , Proof offers trust in a digital world by verifying identities and securing transactions to protect businesses and their customers. Since 2015, weâ€™ve completed many of the worldâ€™s first digital commerce transactions, including the first online real estate closing, online mortgage closing, online auto sale, and online will and we're still just getting started!

  

This role focuses on improving the reliability of our ECS-based production systems. If you're ready to shift away from Kubernetes management to a robust ECS platform, this might be the role for you (some Kubernetes experience is valued).

  

At Proof we have two distinct environments:

  

Production: Run on AWS ECS, emphasizing high availability and performance.

Test: Runs on AWS EKS, providing a flexible, containerized platform for development and testing.
