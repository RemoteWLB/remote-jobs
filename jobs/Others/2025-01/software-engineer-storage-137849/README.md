##  **About Neon**

Neon is building open-source cloud-native PostgreSQL. Our architecture separates storage from compute, allowing for serverless Postgres. We're a well-funded startup with deep knowledge of Postgres internals and decades of experience building databases. We are a systems company; we work on low-level code with strict performance and correctness requirements.

Neon was created by a team of Postgres hackers and led by CEO Nikita Shamgunov (co-founder of SingleStore). Neon is built on open-source principles and is focused on giving back to the Postgres and developer communities.

##  **Our Team**

  * We are a distributed team of 100+ people working from 25+ countries (concentrating around North American and European time zones)

  * We are a team built on open-source cultural principles (transparency, contribution, accountability, and proactivity)

  * Team with decades of experience building databases and deep knowledge of Postgres internals. We are deeply technical

  * We have experienced Postgres committers and hackers on the team (check Heikki, Anastasia, Arseny, Matthias profiles)

  * We believe in the efficacy of collaborative open-source

  * We aim for a diversity of thoughts and backgrounds

  * We are keen to be a fast-moving, flat org and avoid hierarchical structures

##  **Our Investors**

  * Top-tier investors backed up Neon's vision:

    * We raised $104 million in funding from Menlo Ventures, Notable Capital, Khosla Ventures, General Catalyst, and Founders Fund.

    * Venture vehicles of Snowflake and Databricks invested in Neon.

  * Our angel investors are prominent technologists and ecosystem players. More than 20 awesome angels supported Neon, including Nat Friedman, Elad Gil, Mike Ovitz, Ajeet Singh, Guillermo Rauch, SÃ¸ren Brammer Schmidt, and Wes McKinney.

  * Our Board includes Quentin Clark, Glenn Solomon, Joe Morrissey, and Tim Tully.

##  **Our Offer**

  * You have an opportunity to be an early employee in the fast-scaling, ambitious team

  * You can work 100% remote: we'll handle all formalities to arrange work from your home

  * We grant equity (stock options) to all full-time hires

  * We offer a competitive benefits package in line with all tech companies (top-notch equipment, unlimited vacations, paid parental leaves, and much more)

  * We are distributed, yet make our bonds during regular offsites (the last one was in Portugal)
