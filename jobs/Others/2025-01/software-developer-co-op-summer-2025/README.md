As a part of Magnet Forensics, you can expect to make a difference in the world, no matter what role you play. You‚Äôll be supported through learning and development, not to mention an incredible team with unbelievable talent and integrity.

If you think you would be the right person to join our team working towards this goal, we would love to hear from you!

  

_Your Role_

At Magnet Forensics, you will be fully integrated into our software development team. You'll start by getting comfortable with the code, working through bugs and basic features, all the while writing code that will actually be seen in production. As you ramp, you‚Äôll be given more complex features just like any other member of the team. In fact, some of the key features of our software were written by our students!

  

 _What We Are Looking For_

We hire passionate people who enjoy technical challenges. We love problem solvers who want to keep learning, individually and as part of the team. We want people who collaborate and help others. We foster a team environment where everyone is comfortable sharing their ideas, because we understand that with diversity of thought, we will build the best products.

  

We‚Äôre looking for someone who checks off most, but not all, of the boxes. It‚Äôs more important to us to find a candidate who can display **indicators of success** through skills they have developed and experience they have been a part of, than to find folks who have ‚Äúbeen there, done that‚Äù. We want to be a part of your development journey, and we‚Äôll learn as much from you as you learn from us.

  

There are a couple must haves, but we will keep that list short:

-You are a student working towards a degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Software Engineering or a related discipline 

-You‚Äôre strong at object-oriented programming (Languages: Java/JavaScript, C#, C++, Python)

-You are accountable and take ownership of your projects 

-You like working in a collaborative environment with smart, funny and interesting people

  

 _The Most Important Thing_

  

We‚Äôre looking for candidates that can provide examples of how they have demonstrated Magnet **CODE** in their previous experiences:

 **CARE** ‚Äì We care about each other and our mission to make a difference in the world.

 **OWN** ‚Äì We are accountable for our results ‚Äì while never forgetting to act with integrity, empathy, and respect.

 **DEDICATE** ‚Äì We put our heart and soul into meeting the needs of our customers and helping them serve the people they protect.

 **EVOLVE** ‚Äì We are constantly innovating and exploring new ways to work together to make an impact with our work.
