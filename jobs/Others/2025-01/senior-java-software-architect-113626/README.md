 **WHO WE ARE**

At Trustly, weâ€™re on a mission to deliver a better way to pay and get paid. Consumers deserve a payment option that prioritizes financial responsibility, and merchants should have the independence to accept payments without unnecessary costs. This mission drives everything we do.

  

Weâ€™re revolutionizing the payments industry by making Pay by Bank the new standard at checkout, providing a smarter payment option to credit and debit cards. For merchants and consumers, this means the freedom to make and receive payments with greater security and ease.

  

Fueled by this purpose, weâ€™ve grown into a global network connecting 9,000 merchants to 650 million consumers through 12,000 banks across 33 countries, processing over $58 billion annually. As the leader in Pay by Bank, we aim to redefine the payments experience by delivering exceptional products and unmatched value.

  

With regional offices in VitÃ³ria, Brazil and Silicon Valley, USA, and our global headquarters in Stockholm, Sweden, we are a diverse team that spans over 30 nationalities. Embracing a culture of innovation and collaboration, our 'work from anywhere' policy allows employees in Brazil, the U.S., and Canada to work remotely within their country of residence, enabling flexibility while staying connected to our global team.

  

At Trustly, we believe that inclusion and diversity are essential foundations for building a fair and equitable society. We do not discriminate based on race, religion, ancestry, color, national origin, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, or disability status. Our main goal is to provide a fair, welcoming, diverse environment with opportunities for all collaborators. The stages of our selection process take place online and without distinction of any kind.

  

Now is the perfect time to join us and help accomplish our mission. If youâ€™re inspired by purpose, thrive in a fast-paced and entrepreneurial environment, and are ready to shape the future of payments, weâ€™d love to hear from you!
