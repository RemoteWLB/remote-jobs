## Description

 _Your career is an investment that grows over time!_

  

Wealthsimple is on a mission to help everyone achieve financial freedom by reimagining what it means to manage your money. Using smart technology, we take financial services that are often confusing, opaque and expensive and make them transparent and low-cost for everyone. Weâ€™re the largest fintech company in Canada, with over 4 million users who trust us with more than $50 billion in assets.

  

Our teams ship often and make an impact with groundbreaking ideas. We're looking for talented people who keep it simple and value collaboration and humility as we continue to create inclusive and high-performing teams where people can be inspired to do their best work.

  

 **About the team:**

At Wealthsimple, our Fraud and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) teams help manage the client, regulatory and financial risk of financial crime as the business grows. We're seeking an Analytics Developer to support both teams in their mission to protect our platform and clients.

  

The Fraud team is responsible for enabling Wealthsimple to grow safely. We aim to balance fraud risk and client experience: our mission is to minimize fraud losses while reducing false positive fraud alerts. Comprise of experience engineers, product managers, data analysts and data scientists, we develop machine learning models, automated rules, and new in-app features to prevent fraud. Every decision we make is grounded in data to ensure we are not impacting too many or too few clients.

  

The Anti-Money Laundering (AML) team is responsible for detecting, responding to, and eliminating money laundering and terrorist financing risks at Wealthsimple. The AML team relies on data to detect illegal activity on the platform, and data feeds business-critical controls.

  

We are hiring an Analytics Developer to support the Fraud & AML teams. In this role, you'll get first-hand exposure to financial crime rings and learn how to source a wide array of client data to help identify and stop Fraud & AML trends. Your work will help mitigate millions of dollars of attempted fraud annually while protecting the financial security of over 3 million clients.
