#  **TL;dr:**

We have 10 open engineering roles with an industry leader in crypto with 3 billion in revenue. The team is 30 people strong with a _true_ remote first culture. We at G2i placed the senior engineering manager in this company 6 years ago and he came back to us to help his team grow! You _must_ be product minded and sweat the small stuff when it comes to user experience. If you have a high degree of ownership as an engineer you'll be a good fit. If you have experience with growth, memberships, subscriptions (eg. doordash, instacart) that is a huge bonus. We'll want to know more about your super power as an engineer. What are you best at? The team is looking for engineers that aren't just going to pass the tech interviews, but will actually help the team level up as a whole.

 **Tech Stack:** The frontend roles require at least 3 years of overall experience. React is a must. TypeScript and React Native are nice to haves. You'll be working across web and mobile (using RN). Knowledge of Relay and GraphQL are also nice to haves. We also have backend focused roles here and a _very_ senior frontend/fullstack role here.

 **Location:** Fully remote. US or Canada.
