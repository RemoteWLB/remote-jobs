# [G2i Interview Team (Ruby, Go, Python)](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/g2i-interview-team-ruby-go-python)  
### G2i Inc.  
####  

**Accepted Locations**

You can apply from any country. We'll need a mix of interviews in North America, Latam, and Europe/Middle East as the candidates we are interviewing are from those regions.

 **Overview**

Youâ€™ll join a new G2i Interview team to help interview for the Core Team role on our platform. You'll primarily be interviewing non-G2i members for either Ruby, Golang, or Python positions with our clients. You'll be performing 50-min paired programming interviews and evaluating each candidate based on their technical and soft skills abilities.

We'll train you how to perform this interview using our existing technical interview system. After each interview you'll provide a paragraph describing how candidates performed and communicated, their developer category, and a Yes/No answer for passing the interview.

We are looking for 6 interviewers that have at least 20 hours per week available and can do up to 20 interviews per week. If you have more time than this, great! If you enjoy interviewing engineers this is a great opportunity to help the G2i community and earn extra money, $20-$30 per interview.

This team will be lead by Dev Lamichane, Ivor Padilla, and Antonio Mussi!
