# [Storage Engineer](https://www.remotewlb.com/apply/storage-engineer-138572)  
### Supabase  
####  

Supabase Storage is a scalable and high performance object storage service and is one of our fastest growing services. The current landscape of tools for uploading, storing, processing and delivering assets is complicated. Developers are forced to think about regions, caching, codecs and security before they can start uploading anything.

We are looking for engineers to solve this problem once and for all.

You will be working across the entire stack - client libraries, CLI, CDN, the storage server and the deployment infrastructure. One day, you might focus on improving upload resilience in iOS applications; the next, you could be optimizing the S3 protocol for efficient retries or finding ways to accelerate upload processing.

You will be contributing to both our open source server and upstream dependencies we use, like the TUS server.

 **You will be working on:**

  * Developing a processing pipeline for images and videos.

  * Automatic asset optimization to speed up delivery for websites and mobile applications.

  * Building out our edge network to speed up uploads and build features like automatic cache invalidation

  * Improve the performance, observability, and reliability of our storage server.

  * Work with the frontend team to build a fast, powerful storage explorer.

  * Improve our APIs, client libraries and CLI to provide an exceptional end-to-end DX for our users.

  * Resolve escalated support issues, while also identifying and resolving systemic issues across the platform.

 **You are:**

  * A strong Node.js developer with at least 5 years of experience.

  * Worked with CDNs like Cloudflare or Cloudfront.

  * Comfortable with working across the stack - backend application development, some infrastructure work including deploying, monitoring and scaling the service.

  * Experience with image and video processing tools (sharp, dssim, ffmpeg), formats and codecs (AVIF, WebM, Brotli) is a plus.

  * Experience with the frontend ecosystem (Next.js, React, etc) is a plus.

### We offer

  * 100% remote work from anywhere in the world. No location-based adjustment to your salary.

  * ESOP (equity ownership in the company)

  * Autonomous work. We work collaboratively on projects, but you set your own pace.

  * Health, Vision and Dental benefits. Supabase covers 100% of the cost for employees and 80% for dependents

  * Tech Allowance for any office setup you need

  * Annual Education Allowance

  * Annually run off-sites.

## About the team

  * We're a startup. It's unstructured.

  * Collectively founded more than 30 startups.

  * Globally distributed team with more than 30 different nationalities.

  * We deeply believe in the efficacy of collaborative open source. We support existing communities and tools, rather than building "yet another xx".

  * We "dogfood" everything. If you use it in your project, we use it in Supabase.

## Process

  * The entire process is fully remote and all communication will happen over email or via video chat.

  * Once you've submitted your application, the team will review your submission and may reach out for a short screening interview over a video call.

  * If you pass the screen you will be invited to up to four follow-up interviews. 

  * The calls:

    * usually take between 20-45 minutes each depending on the interviewer.

    * most of the time, are all 1:1.

    * will be with the founders, a member of either the growth or engineering team (depending on the role) and usually one other person from your immediate team or function.

  * Once the interviews are over, the team will meet to discuss several roles and candidates and may:

    * ask one or two follow-up questions over email or a quick call.

    * go directly to making an offer.
