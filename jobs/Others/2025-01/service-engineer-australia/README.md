## Description

 **About Omnidian**

Omnidian, Inc. is a fast-growing Series C tech-enabled service company revolutionizing performance assurance for the distributed solar and energy storage industries. Omnidian is building a more sustainable future for the planet through our passionate teams, our innovative technology, and by creating an amazing customer experience. _We are headquartered in the US and began our Australia team in 2022, with exciting growth since then._

  

 **The Job**

  

As a Service Engineer at Omnidian, youâ€™ll have a significant role in shaping the future of our operations. Youâ€™ll use your engineering expertise, critical thinking, and leadership skills to identify and resolve technical challenges, mentor teammates, and drive impactful process improvements.

  

This isnâ€™t a role for someone who wants to follow a scriptâ€”youâ€™ll apply your judgment, problem-solving capabilities, and passion for renewable energy to make a difference. In addition to diagnosing and resolving solar system performance issues, youâ€™ll help build scalable processes, support continuous improvement initiatives, and play a key role in training and mentoring team members.

  

 _While we have a preference for those based in Western or Eastern Australia, location is flexible for the right person (but must be in Australia)._
