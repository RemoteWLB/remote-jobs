### Serotonin  
#### `ðŸŒŽ remote,New York`  

## Description

Our client is the first Bitcoin security-equivalent Layer2 solution based on BitVM approach. Their core objective is to address the trade-off between security and Turing completeness in Bitcoin Layer2s through cryptographic innovations and blockchain protocol engineering. This is intended to ultimately foster a prosperous Bitcoin ecosystem.

  

Operating in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space, providing secure infrastructure for the creation and management of decentralized digital assets. They specialize in developing solutions for transactions and asset management that prioritize privacy and security. By integrating advanced cryptographic protocols, the platform allows users to issue, transfer, and track digital assets, such as tokens or digital currencies, with a focus on scalability and efficiency. Additionally, they offer services that enable users to automate complex financial operations and manage assets across multiple blockchains seamlessly.
