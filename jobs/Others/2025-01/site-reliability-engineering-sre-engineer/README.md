* Influence architectural decisions during initial design stages to ensure resiliency and scale at the outset of software development.
* Design processes, playbooks and checklists for other engineers to follow during and after incidents
* Write post mortems and perform technical after-action reviews to understand root cause and propose system improvements to reduce overall fault rates
* Interact with members from almost all teams across the business to understand their monitoring, alerting and SLO / SLA requirements and design systems and processes that ensure we meet or exceed these requirements.
* Automate the provisioning of monitoring tools and rules with tools like Terraform and Ansible / Chef
* Design base level requirements for new and existing services to ensure that all dLocal infrastructure and code are monitored consistently and accurately at a basic level.
