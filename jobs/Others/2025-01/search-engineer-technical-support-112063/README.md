 **About the Team**

The technical support team leverages their extensive experience supporting large-scale Solr clusters and the Lucene/Solr ecosystem. Their day might include troubleshooting errors and attempting to fix or develop workarounds, diagnosing network and environmental issues, learning your customer's infrastructure and technologies, as well as reproducing bugs and opening Jira tickets for the engineering team. Their primary tasks are break/fix scenarios where the diagnostics quickly bring network assets back online and prevent future problems - which has a huge impact on our customersâ€™ business.

  

**About the Role**

Weâ€™re looking for a support engineer with a wide range of technical abilities to communicate with customers to gather data about the problems they are facing, as well as working with the engineering team and vendors to perform root cause analysis (RCA) and, ultimately, resolutions. This means continuous contact with the customer and a high level of attentiveness to their needs and priorities.

This role balances technical depth with empathy for the customerâ€™s needs and a drive to continually improve the products and ensure an excellent customer experience. You are the first line in our Customer Success team to help our users.

  

This role is remote and open to US based candidates. There is a strong preference for candidates located in Pacific and Mountain time zones.

  

This role will provide primary support to our U.S. government customers.

  

 **About You**

You are a curious-minded, natural problem solver who plays well with others and cares about the work, the team, and the customers. You are able to work collaboratively with a diverse community of personalities spread across multiple time zones, leveraging your excellent communication skills to make sure everyone is on the same page. You leverage all of your technical and people skills to become a trusted advisor for your customers and peers, both internal and external.

  

 **Our Stack:**

Apache Lucene/Solr, ZooKeeper, Spark, and Pulsar

Java, Python, Linux, Kubernetes

Zendesk, Jira

  

 **This is a remote role and will remain remote.**

  

This role is expected to participate in weekend on-call rotations.
