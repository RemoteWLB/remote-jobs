## Description

 **Help us make a big green dent in the universe.** We're on a mission to drive the global renewable energy revolution, and we need loads more people to help us make our vision a reality.

  

We're looking for **Smart Meter Engineers** with a proven track record of safety and customer excellence. Youâ€™ll be representing our brands in our customersâ€™ homes; in many cases, the first face-to-face contact a customer has with Octopus Energy - so our expectations are high.

  

Youâ€™ll be just as happy talking to the customer and getting to know them as you are about doing the installation itself. Youâ€™ll be fitting meters; showing customers how their meter and in-home display works; how it can help them save energy and answering any questions about the green energy revolution we are leading.

  

As part of the Octopus Energy Services team, weâ€™ll ensure you have the best of everything you need to deliver the top class service weâ€™re aiming for. Youâ€™ll be supported by an office team who will share the same performance goals, so weâ€™re always working as one team to deliver the best possible experience for the customer. Youâ€™ll also have the backing of Octopus Energyâ€™s massive tech power - so weâ€™ll be able to constantly evolve and shift processes to ensure weâ€™re always delivering our best service. This should help to keep admin to a minimum, allowing you to focus on what you do best.
