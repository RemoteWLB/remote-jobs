### Supabase  
####  

Supabase is an open-source and fully remote company building developer tools for databases.

Management API, written in TypeScript, Nest.js and other JavaScript technologies, is a central part of every product in the Supabase stack. It allows all Supabase services and Supabase Studio communicate with each other, programmatically manage your own Supabase projects and organizations, as well as integrate with 3rd party services like Vercel, Resend, or Lovable. We are seeking someone to help us maintain existing API, expand OAuth applications capabilities, enhance reliability, and improve overall public API experience.

### You will:

  * Design, implement, and maintain both internal and public-facing APIs used across various Supabase products, including Studio, CLI, management APIs, and OAuth applications.

  * Integrate with third-party platforms and partners, either by developing custom integrations or providing clear API points for them to connect with Supabase.

  * Collaborate closely with various teams across Supabase (DevOps, Frontend, etc.) to ensure smooth integration and implementation of API functionality for the rest of the platform.

  * Build and enhance testing, debugging, and monitoring tools to ensure public APIs' stability, reliability, and performance.

  * Design, build, and enhance tools for testing, debugging, and monitoring to ensure the stability, reliability, and performance of public APIs.

### You have:

  * 5+ years of experience in backend API development, with strong expertise in TypeScript and JavaScript (Node.js) and familiarity with modern tools and frameworks (e.g., Nest.js, Express, Vitest, Zod).

  * Expertise in designing robust, scalable, and maintainable APIs, and experience with API versioning, pagination, and error handling best practices. Experience with OAuth, JWT, and API security best practices (rate limiting, CORS, etc.) is a plus.

  * Good understanding of PostgreSQL and relational databases.

  * Proven ability to build scalable, maintainable APIs and develop tools for testing, debugging, and monitoring API performance.

  * Understanding of CI/CD pipelines, Docker, and containerized deployments to streamline API development, testing, and release processes.

### We offer:

  * 100% remote work from anywhere in the world. No location-based adjustment to your salary.

  * Autonomous work. We work collaboratively on projects, but you set your own pace.

  * Health, Vision and Dental benefits. Supabase covers 100% of the cost for employees and 80% for dependants

  * Collectively founded more than 30 startups.

  * Globally distributed team with more than 30 different nationalities.

  * We deeply believe in the efficacy of collaborative open source. We support existing communities and tools, rather than building "yet another xx".

## Process

  * The entire process is fully remote and all communication will happen over email or via video chat.

  * Once you've submitted your application, the team will review your submission and may reach out for a short screening interview over a video call.

  * The calls:

    * usually take between 20-45 minutes each depending on the interviewer.

    * most of the time, are all 1:1.

    * will be with the founders, a member of either the growth or engineering team (depending on the role) and usually one other person from your immediate team or function.

  * Once the interviews are over, the team will meet to discuss several roles and candidates and may:

    * ask one or two follow-up questions over email or a quick call.
