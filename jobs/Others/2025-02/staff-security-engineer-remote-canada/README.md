**About Us:**

Our mission at Wrapbook is to increase the prosperity of the project economy. A significant shift has occurred within the workforce recently and 50M Americans are now engaged in freelance or project-based work. The popularity of project based employment has introduced flexibility for both employers and employees but also added complexities from a compensation and administrative standpoint. Our vertical fintech platform enables companies to seamlessly onboard, pay and insure their workforces.

We’re building the best product for the entertainment industry but operate in a 50B market and have big goals we want to achieve. With legacy competition slow to react and over 30M raised from Andreessen Horowitz, Equal Ventures, Uncork Capital, Jeffrey Katzenberg and CAA co-founder Michael Ovitz, we are at an exciting stage of growth and there isn’t a better time to join!

  * Collaborate with GRC and IT peers to identify and reduce risks across the company's technology ecosystem, ensuring a holistic approach to security.

  * Define security requirements for product design, architecture, and implementation.

  * Participate in Security's on-call rotation and help improve our incident response practices.

  * Help build an effective security culture through training, presentations, and best practice advocacy.

  * Establish and maintain core processes, standards, and tooling for the Security Engineering team.

 **What You’ll Have**

  * This Staff-level role requires at least 8 years of direct security experience.

    * You have broad security expertise and can demonstrate knowledge of core concepts including confidentiality, availability, least privilege, integrity, RBAC, and OWASP top ten.

    * You possess deep application security knowledge, with the ability to evaluate feature design risks and integrate security tools into the application stack.

    * You understand cloud and infrastructure security, including cloud-native network architecture, and can recommend appropriate security controls across application, infrastructure, and network layers.

    * You have web application or software development experience, with the ability to read and write code (Ruby and Ruby on Rails preferred) and assess application stack security.

    * You are experienced in technical project management, breaking complex challenges into actionable phases while leading teams to achieve technical goals.

  * You're a motivated problem solver who brings critical thinking and curiosity to building secure, user-friendly products.

  * You thrive on virtual collaboration, building strong relationships with remote team members across the company.

  * You demonstrate technical leadership through empathy for customers and partners, active listening, and a commitment to helping others grow professionally.

 **Why Join Us:**
