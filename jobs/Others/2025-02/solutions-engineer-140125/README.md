# **About Goldsky**

Goldsky is a realtime onchain data platform, giving developers access to world-class data infrastructure to power their onchain applications. With lightning-fast indexing, resilient subgraphs, and flexible data streaming pipelines, Goldsky lets you spend less time on infra and more time building core UX.

Goldsky subgraphs are optimized to improve querying performance, giving you realtime data access while handling complexities like reorgs & RPC failures automatically. Mirror allows you to sync onchain data directly into your existing database setup for custom usage across your frontend or backend.

Battle-tested at scale by top projects like Polymarket, 0x, and Puffer, Goldsky remains the indexing partner of choice for leading chains including Abstract, Unichain, Kraken, Berachain, Immutable, and more.

We’ve raised over $20M from Dragonfly Capital, Felicis Ventures, prominent players in the industry such as 0x Labs, Uniswap Labs, and Protocol Labs, and angel investors including Elad Gil, Plaid founders Zach Perret and William Hockey, and Zhuoxun Yin of Magic Eden. Our team members have previously built mission-critical, scalable infrastructure at Meta, Google, Shopify, Activision, and more.

#  **About the Role**

We’d love for you to join us in **building the most powerful data platform for Web3.** ☀️

We're looking to bring on a Solutions Engineer to our Technical Services team. The Technical Services team is responsible for pre- and post-sale engagements with current and future customers.

You'll become a product expert and will help unblock our customers using that expertise. We're a small team, and in this role you will wear many hats. You'll work cross-functionally with many teams and stakeholders to address customer-facing issues, help with product launches, and give feedback about how our customers are using the product. Supporting our customers through their technical journey is critical to our success, and you'll play a key role in ensuring they get the most value from our platform.

#  **What You’ll Do**

  * Master our platform inside and out, becoming the expert who can guide customers through their unique challenges. You’ll develop such deep knowledge that you can help customers understand their options, weigh tradeoffs, and determine if Goldsky is the right fit for their needs.

  * Our customers need to consume data in many different ways, and you’ll be at the forefront of building reusable data products that streamline these processes. You’ll spot patterns in customer needs and transform them into scalable solutions.

  * Create compelling demos and detailed guides to showcase our platform’s capabilities. Your work will help customers discover and implement our solutions independently.

  * In the rapidly evolving Web3 space, you’ll encounter novel technical challenges daily. Your problem-solving skills will shine as you develop practical solutions, investigate root causes, and iterate until you find the optimal approach.

#  **Who You Are**

  *  **You’re a generalist.** You thrive on variety and approach new challenges with enthusiasm. You’re comfortable stepping outside your comfort zone and know when to ask for help.

  *  **You’re technically savvy.** You can write SQL queries confidently and aren’t afraid to dive into the command line or codebase to provide real-time feedback to the Engineering team.

  *  **You’re curious, low ego, and growth-oriented.** You embrace feedback, experiment with new approaches, and work alongside others to find the best solutions. Your low-ego approach makes you a natural team player.

  *  **You love a bit of chaos.** You’re energized by the fast pace and ambiguity of startup life. Remote work feels natural to you, and you excel at creating structure where none exists.

  *  **You’re a connector.** You understand the value of strong, lasting connections with both teammates and customers.

  *  **You’re a Web3 enthusiast.** You’re eager to explore and learn more about the exciting (and slightly wacky) world of crypto.

#  **Bonus Points**

  * You’ve tackled technical products and customers before, especially in B2B SaaS.

  * You can read and write basic code across multiple programming languages.

  * You understand the Web3 ecosystem and share our vision for how Goldsky will revolutionize it.

#  **Benefits & Perks**

  *  **Health Insurance** \- Employer-paid medical, dental, and vision plans for you and your family.

  *  **Retirement** \- 401(k) plan through Vestwell.

  *  **Flexible Time Off** \- Take time to recharge as you need it. We’re serious.

  *  **Self Care Days** \- Every other Friday we have off. These days reflect our work philosophy: nine days at 110%, followed by one day to recharge.

  *  **Home Office Stipend:** $2,000 to create your dream office.

  *  **New Macbook:** We set you up with the best hardware + a refresh every 2 years.

  *  **Wellness Stipend:** $100/mo for whatever helps you stay healthy.

  *  **Connectivity Stipend:** $75/mo to cover your phone or internet bill.

  *  **Quarterly Travel:** We meet up 4x per year for company onsites and retreats all around the globe.
