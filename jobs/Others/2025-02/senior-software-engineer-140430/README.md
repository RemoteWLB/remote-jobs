# About Enode

At Enode, our mission is to accelerate the transition to a sustainable energy system by connecting and optimizing the world‚Äôs energy devices. A fully renewable energy system is dependent on flexible demand that can adapt to the intermittent supply from wind and solar. To create this flexibility, we need to connect to and control the fast-growing demand coming from electric vehicles, heat pumps and other energy hardware. This is what we‚Äôre doing at Enode. Our APIs power the next generation of green energy apps, with our customers representing over 250 million consumers worldwide. Yet, we‚Äôre still at the start of our journey, and we want exceptional people to join us.
