üëã Hi! I‚Äôm Chapman, and I am the leader of our Solutions Engineering team here at Ashby. I joined our sales team back in 2022, and have had the pleasure of building our solutions engineering team and approach from the ground up.

When I first joined I was really excited about how _different_ Ashby was when compared to other hiring platforms. I spoke to my colleagues who had spent their careers recruiting and it became clear that the current tools left a lot to be desired across the entire process - from outreach to offer - and there was a huge opportunity for transformation.

Since joining I‚Äôve had the chance to support our most strategic customers as they purchase Ashby - after speaking with hundreds of talent acquisition leaders I have never been more convinced that our product is transformative.

As an SE, you want to be selling a product that customers fall in love with. There‚Äôs nothing better than seeing a prospect's jaw _literally_ drop in the middle of a demo, and it only happens when you have a solution that solves _real_ pain for someone. At Ashby it happens daily.

I‚Äôm really excited that we‚Äôre expanding our SE team as our product moves further up market and we work with larger and larger customers. Our success will require a highly skilled, diverse, and collaborative SE team to partner with sales to ensure our customers have a deep understanding of the impact Ashby can have on their business. If that sounds compelling to you, read on for the job details!

##  **About this role**

As a Solutions Engineer at Ashby you‚Äôll be at the forefront of our sales efforts with Mid-Market and Enterprise customers, partnering closely with Account Executives to secure both the technical and commercial win.

You‚Äôll play a crucial role in mid-market and enterprise sales cycles, where you will deliver personalized product demonstrations, facilitate well-structured product trials, and coordinate comprehensive and insightful RFP responses. Success in this role means using your discovery skills, empathy for our customers, and product knowledge to clearly articulate the transformative impact Ashby can have on their business.

When prospects are _eager_ to buy‚Äîsomething that happens often because our product truly stands out‚Äîyou‚Äôll know you‚Äôre hitting the mark!
