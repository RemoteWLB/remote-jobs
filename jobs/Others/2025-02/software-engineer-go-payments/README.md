**What do we do?**

Paddle offers SaaS companies a completely different approach to their payment infrastructure. Instead of assembling and maintaining a complex stack of payments-related apps and services, we’re a Merchant of Record for our customers. That means we take away 100% of the pain of payment fragmentation. It’s faster, safer, cheaper, and, above all, way better.

We’re backed by investors including KKR, FTV Capital, Kindred, Notion, and 83North and serve over 3000 software sellers in 245 territories globally.

**The Role:**

As a Software Engineer in our Settlements team, you will contribute to the development of our core ledger, commission, tax, and payout systems, a critical part of Paddle’s billing and payments infrastructure solution.

We often work with a range of other teams, including Payments, Infosec, Platform (SRE) and Billing teams. You’ll get to collaborate alongside engineers, product managers, designers, and finance experts. Getting involved in a wide range of areas which will provide you with plenty of opportunities to develop your own skills and ultimately grow your career as a valued member of the engineering team.

 **What you'll do:**

  * Develop and maintain financially-critical systems used by a rapidly growing global customer base, processing hundreds of millions of dollars per month

  * Working primarily with our backend systems written in Go, or at times migrating legacy services from PHP, collaborate on features from initial concept and planning, right through to rollout

  * Collaborate with other engineers and non-technical colleagues, as well as working independently, with excellent written and verbal communication.

  * Design a stable and high quality platform with your team by implementing testing strategies, and also by having an eye for edge-cases and system design

  * Practise DevOps: you’re responsible for getting your code to production, supporting and monitoring its performance, and helping to keep our AWS infrastructure efficient

 **We'd love to hear from you if you:**

  * Have a solid development background with Go (PHP experience is a bonus)

  * Have experience designing and building critical systems to handle high traffic at scale in a cloud-based environment in AWS

  * Are someone who enjoys collaborating with our technical and non-technical departments

  * Have a proactive attitude towards finding ways to improve the code and team processes

  * Are someone who takes pride in what you build

  * Are intellectually curious about payments, finance, and infosec
