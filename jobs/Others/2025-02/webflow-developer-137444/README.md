Notable is the leading intelligent automation company for healthcare. Customers use Notable to drive patient acquisition, retention, and reimbursement, scaling growth without hiring more staff. We don’t just make software.

We are on a mission to fix the broken U.S. healthcare system by helping to eliminate the massive administrative burden that is placed on our nation’s healthcare staff. We hire people from diverse backgrounds and are always looking for employees who bring fresh ideas to our space. Passion is paramount, and at Notable, you will get to work with other talented people who aim to set a new standard for innovation in healthcare.

 **Role Summary**

We are seeking a web developer with deep Webflow expertise (in addition to other technologies) to join our internal Brand Design team to expand, uplevel and accelerate our web and digital presence. You will be instrumental in the transformation of our current brochuresite to a multi-faceted destination to serve our growing customer base, enabling our internal teams to build and deploy dynamic content through a well-crafted, easy to use CMS. The ideal candidate is comfortable at the intersection of design and development, passionate about bringing concepts to life through innovative solutions, meticulous in craft, and committed to problem-solving and shipping with urgency.

 **What you’ll do**

  * Develop and manage Notable’s main Webflow instance (and additional web properties as needed: e.g. event landing pages, product or marketing microsites) ensuring robust site architecture, ABM infrastructure, analytics, and CMS ease-of-use, among other technical stewardship.

  * Partner closely with Marketing, Design and other functional areas to translate visual or content concepts to functional, intuitive, beautiful web experiences.

  * Proactively and meticulously triage priorities across new initiatives and ongoing maintenance and improvements.

  * Own the reliability and/or any urgent/ad-hoc requirements as may be needed by the business (as well as manage redundant coverage as needed)

  * Build or advise on other web/digital initiatives that may require technical knowledge (e.g. emails, webinars)

 **What we’re looking for**

  * Ideally 5+ years of experience in-house working alongside small, nimble teams with a desire to unblock and creatively problem solve.

  * Strong preference for a design/developer hybrid who can help push the envelope as to what’s possible, and partner alongside other brand designers to realize a shared vision. (Minimally, fluent in principles of good UX and visual design with the ability to read between the lines to execute a vision without perfect instruction/handoff).

  * Strong collaboration and project management skills, with the ability to work across departments and manage multiple priorities in a fast-paced environment.
