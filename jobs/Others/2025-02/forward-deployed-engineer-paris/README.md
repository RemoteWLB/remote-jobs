**About the Team**

Over the past year, we have experienced a significant increase in demand for OpenAI's hands-on technical expertise to translate abstract ideas into production applications. We’ve established a Forward Deployed Engineering (FDE) team who will work closely with our most strategic customers to deeply understand their use cases and design, build, and implement products for them. As one of our founding FDEs, you will deploy these solutions on customer infrastructure for the world's most influential businesses, driving real business impact through our newest models and our own innovations in technical delivery.

 **About the Role**

We are looking for customer-focused engineers to build effective, iterative solutions on OpenAI’s API. As an FDE, you’ll embed with customers, understand their domain, and co-develop solutions to tackle real problems in often undefined or evolving problem spaces. You will collaborate closely with Sales, Solutions Engineering, Solutions Architects, and Customer Success Managers who work on the same account. You will also work with our Research and Applied Product and Engineering teams to provide insightful customer feedback.

This role is based in our Paris office. We use a hybrid work model of 3 days in the office per week and offer relocation assistance to new employees.

  * Embed deeply with strategic customers to understand their business challenges and technical requirements in detail.

  * Design, architect, and develop full-stack solutions using an experiment-driven, iterative approach.

  * Prepare detailed scopes of work and project plans for both proof-of-concept prototypes and full production deployments.

  * Work hands-on with customers' technical teams as a technical expert and trusted advisor, coding side-by-side to drive projects to completion on their infrastructure.

  * Collaborate closely with Sales, Technical Success, and Applied teams to ensure seamless customer experiences, project success and actionable product feedback

  * Contribute to internal knowledge bases, codifying best practices and sharing insights gained from customer engagements to scale the Forward Deployed Engineering function.

 **You’ll thrive in this role if you:**

  * Have 4+ years of experience in software or customer engineering roles, with a strong emphasis on customer-facing engagements.

  * Are willing to travel up to 50% and work on-site with customers to build strong relationships and deeply understand their needs.

  * Have a track record of rapidly prototyping ideas from your own volition and seeing them through to reality.

  * Are proficient in front-end development using frameworks like React or Next.js, and back-end development skills in Python, Node.js, or similar.

  * Are familiar with deploying applications on cloud platforms such as AWS, GCP, or Azure.

  * Are an effective communicator who can translate complex technical concepts to both technical and non-technical audiences with empathy and depth.

  * Have a bias for action and willingness to work iteratively with your customers to deliver the right solution that solves their problem.

  * Own problems end-to-end, and be willing to pick up whatever knowledge you're missing to get the job done.
