# **Software Engineer - Mobile / React Native**

Virta Health is pioneering a new standard of care for people to reclaim their lives. We are in the midst of a public health crisis: obesity rates are at an all-time high and over half of US adults have type 2 diabetes or prediabetes, and despite billions spent on new treatments, outcomes are largely worse. Virta reverses these diseases and delivers life-changing results by pairing individualized nutrition with ongoing care from a clinical support team. We have raised over $350 million from top-tier investors, and partner with the largest health plans, employers, and government organizations to help their employees and members restore their health and take back their lives.

We’re looking for product-minded mobile engineers who have a keen design intuition, an eye for detail, and most importantly, compassion for our patients. In this role, you will be building features and maintaining our cross-platform application that is used daily by our members. Your work will have a direct and meaningful impact on our members lives.

# Responsibilities

  * Develop medium to large scale, initiatives in the Virta mobile application utilizing React Native, TypeScript, and platform specific tooling

  * Modernize existing screens and components to improve our patient experience and support our internationalization and localization efforts

  * Collaborate with product, design, clinical, and applied AI teams to deliver new features to patients

  * Troubleshoot, debug, and fix issues with the mobile application

  * Collaborate and be part of the mobile release process as a mobile release manager in partnership with QA and stakeholders

  * Collaborate with other engineers on the team and promote high quality software engineering practices

  * Be a point of reference to unblock fullstack and frontend engineers who are contributing to the mobile codebase

# 90 Day Plan

Within your first 90 days at Virta, we expect you will do the following:

  * Release at least one medium feature on the mobile app

  * Collaborate with other engineering team members through knowledge sharing, pair programming, and giving feedback in code reviews

  * Propose and implement one or more process/product improvements to make our engineering team and developer experience even better

# Must-Haves

  * 3.5+ years software engineering experience building mobile apps using React Native or similar technologies

  * Experience working with backend teams integrating REST or GraphQL APIs

  * An eye for design, a love of your craft, and empathy for our users. You should be able to critique and think through how designs will impact our end users, not just the code

# Values-driven culture

Virta’s company values drive our culture, so you’ll do well if:

  * You put **_people first_** and take care of yourself, your peers, and our patients equally

  * You have a strong sense of **_ownership_** and take initiative while empowering others to do the same

  * You prioritize positive **_impact_** over busy work

  * You have **_no ego_** and understand that everyone has something to bring to the table regardless of experience

  * You appreciate **_transparency_** and promote trust and empowerment through open access of information

  * You are **_evidence-based_** and prioritize data and science over seniority or dogma

  * You **_take risks and rapidly iterate_**
