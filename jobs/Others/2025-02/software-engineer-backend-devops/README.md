**About Goldsky**

Goldsky is a realtime onchain data platform, giving developers access to world-class data infrastructure to power their onchain applications. With lightning-fast indexing, resilient subgraphs, and flexible data streaming pipelines, Goldsky lets you spend less time on infra and more time building core UX.

Goldsky subgraphs are optimized to improve querying performance, giving you realtime data access while handling complexities like reorgs & RPC failures automatically. Mirror allows you to sync onchain data directly into your existing database setup for custom usage across your frontend or backend.

Battle-tested at scale by top projects like Polymarket, 0x, and Puffer, Goldsky remains the real-time indexing partner of choice for leading chains including Abstract, Unichain, Kraken, Berachain, Immutable, and more.

We’ve raised over $20M from Dragonfly Capital, Felicis Ventures, prominent players in the industry such as 0x Labs, Uniswap Labs, and Protocol Labs, and angel investors including Elad Gil, Plaid founders Zach Perret and William Hockey, and Zhuoxun Yin of Magic Eden. Our team members have previously built mission-critical, scalable infrastructure at Meta, Google, Datadog, Shopify, Activision, and more.
