####  

At Serve Robotics, we’re reimagining how things move in cities. Our personable sidewalk robot is our vision for the future. It’s designed to take deliveries away from congested streets, make deliveries available to more people, and benefit local businesses. The Serve fleet has been delighting merchants, customers, and pedestrians along the way in Los Angeles while doing commercial deliveries.

The Serve fleet has been delighting merchants, customers, and pedestrians along the way in Los Angeles while doing commercial deliveries. We’re looking for talented individuals who will grow robotic deliveries from surprising novelty to efficient ubiquity.

###  **Who We Are**

We are tech industry veterans in software, hardware, and design who are pooling our skills to build the future we want to live in. We are solving real-world problems leveraging robotics, machine learning and computer vision, among other disciplines, with a mindful eye towards the end-to-end user experience. Our team is agile, diverse, and driven. We believe that the best way to solve complicated dynamic problems is collaboratively and respectfully.

 **What you'll be doing**

As a Lead Systems Verification & Validation Engineer, you are responsible for demonstrating and ensuring that our robot is safe, robust, performant, and satisfies market/customer needs. You will own the verification & validation of requirements for an autonomous last-mile delivery robot, both building out the high-level test plans all the way to defining the individual test cases and how they’re executed. You will work across many teams and disciplines to help define and orchestrate the test and evaluation of a complex system by breaking high-level product goals and system requirements down into actionable strategies and methods for evaluation.

 **Responsibilities**

  * Lead interdisciplinary teams to define verification & validation plans that ensure all requirements are satisfied and the delivery of a safe and responsible autonomous product

  * Work cross-functionally to develop novel strategies and methods to verify and validate both the hardware and software of an autonomous sidewalk delivery robot, drawing on analysis, simulation, HIL testing, and vehicle testing

  * Execute the technical and logistical planning of vehicle tests including cross-functional coordination with other teams, such as hardware, firmware, and autonomy

  * Maintain traceability between requirements, test cases, and results

  * Work cross-functionally to develop detailed simulations and structured test plans and procedures

  * Troubleshoot and debug issues in the field, and trace failures to correct subsystems

  * Perform test data analysis and report test results. Define and develop automated data extraction tools to streamline analysis and reporting

 **Qualifications**

  * B.S. in Mechanical, Electrical, Software or equivalent engineering field

  * 8+ years of experience in the design and test of complex electromechanical and/or robotic systems

  * Experience with systems engineering fundamentals, particularly verification & validation methods

  * Experience with test scripting and data analysis languages (e.g. Python and SQL)

  * Experience in data analysis of test results including probability and statistical analysis techniques

  * Hands-on approach to the test and debugging of electromechanical systems

  * Fundamental knowledge of mechanical, electrical, and software engineering

  * Excellent written and verbal communication skills for audiences ranging from technicians to senior executives

 **What makes you standout**

  * M.S., or Ph.D in Mechanical, Electrical, Software or equivalent engineering field

  * Experience in one or more of the following industries: automotive, medical, aerospace, robotics

  * Experience in autonomous systems and/or mobile robotics

  * Experience working in Unix/Linux environments
