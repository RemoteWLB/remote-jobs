**Location: Remote (US only)**

 **Contract: Full time (Direct Hire)**

 **Budget: 150-200k**

Our client is looking for an Infrastructure Engineer who thrives in a startup environment—where infrastructure needs to be built from the ground up rather than simply maintained. If you have experience working in both cloud and on-premise environments, enjoy solving complex problems, and prioritize automation and security, we want to hear from you.

 **What You’ll Do:**

  * Design, build, and maintain infrastructure from scratch in both cloud and on-premise environments.

  * Develop Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Pulumi or Terraform CDK, with a focus on drift detection, policies as code, and robust testing (unit, property, and integration tests).

  * Implement and manage CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions, GitLab Pipelines, or similar tools, ensuring efficient caching, versioning, vulnerability scanning, and artifact signing.

  * Deploy and manage Kubernetes clusters, ensuring seamless operation of stateful applications, service mesh configurations (Istio, Linkerd), and modern deployment strategies (rolling updates, blue/green deployments, etc.).

  * Establish comprehensive observability practices, leveraging OpenTelemetry for structured logging, distributed tracing, performance monitoring, and alerting.

  * Architect and optimize networking infrastructure, including VPCs, subnets, CIDR planning, VPN configurations, and automated SSL/TLS certificate management.

  * Oversee database management, ensuring seamless schema migrations, zero-downtime upgrades, backup strategies, and change data capture (CDC) implementation.

  * Implement secure secrets management using tools like Infisical or HashiCorp Vault, ensuring secret rotation, dynamic secrets generation, and audit logging.

  * Manage identity and access control policies, leveraging IAM solutions such as Active Directory, SSO (SAML, OpenID Connect), and ABAC/RBAC models.

  * Set up and maintain private artifact stores and registries (Artifactory, Nexus, Harbor, NPM, PyPI, Cargo, etc.), incorporating vulnerability scanning and suppression.

 **What We’re Looking For:**

  * Proven experience building infrastructure from scratch, not just optimizing or scaling existing setups.

  * Deep knowledge of cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure) and experience managing on-premise infrastructure.

  * Strong hands-on experience with Infrastructure as Code (IaC), CI/CD pipelines, Kubernetes, observability, networking, databases, and security best practices.

  * A track record of contributions to open-source projects or an active GitHub profile is highly preferred.

  * Strong problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and a security-first mindset.

  * Ability to work autonomously in a fast-paced startup environment.

 **What We Don’t Care About:**

  * Certifications—we care about real-world experience over credentials.

  * Buzzwords—if your experience is limited to managed cloud services without self-hosting expertise, this role may not be the best fit.

If you’re excited about building infrastructure from the ground up and working in a dynamic, high-impact role, we’d love to hear from you.

 **Apply now and help shape the future of our infrastructure!**
