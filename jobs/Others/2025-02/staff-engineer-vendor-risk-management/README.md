At Vanta, our mission is to secure the internet and protect consumer data. We believe that security should be monitored and verified continuously, and we empower companies to practice better security and prove it with ease. Vanta has a kind and talented team, and while some have prior security experience, many have been successful at Vanta without it.

The Vendor Risk Management (VRM) product was designed to provide software buyers with tools to evaluate the security of their vendors by inventorying vendors, prioritizing risks, automating security reviews and remediating findings. VRM or Third party Risk Management (TPRM) presents a massive opportunity for Vanta - representing a market of $5-$10B in ARR and a CAGR of 10.8% driven by secular tailwinds in the industry that requires more focussed and deeper scrutiny of the company’s supply chain.

Our Staff Software Engineers identify key strategic initiatives across engineering, deliver significant value to our customers and business, and set the tone for engineering excellence and culture. In this role on the Vendor Risk Management (VRM) team, you'll start on the Data Platform initiative and help drive and set the vision for a solution that continuously retrieves and enriches the breadth and depth of data we have about vendors. This is a huge unlock for the Vendor Risk Management product and will help software buyers **continuously and comprehensively** monitor risks across their vendor supply chain.

 **About Vanta**

We started in 2018, in the wake of several high-profile data breaches. Online security was only becoming more important, but we knew firsthand how hard it could be for fast-growing companies to invest the time and manpower it takes to build a solid security foundation. Vanta was inspired by a vision to restore trust in internet businesses by enabling companies to improve and prove their security.From our early days automating security monitoring for compliance standards like SOC 2, HIPAA and ISO 27001 to creating the world's leading Trust Management Platform, our vision remains unchanged.

Now more than ever, making security continuous—not just a point-in-time check— is essential. Thousands of companies rely on Vanta to build, maintain and demonstrate their trust— all in a way that's real-time and transparent.
