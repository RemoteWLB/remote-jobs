### None  
####  

Neon is an open-source company on a mission to enable developers to ship faster on a serverless platform (which is powered by Postgres at the bottom of the stack).

As we've grown our serverless Postgres offering, we're now looking to expand it with more functionalities at the application development layer. We're looking for an experienced software engineer who is interested in contributing to these efforts.

More specifically, we're looking to augment the team with an engineer that is experienced with different methods for full-stack application deployment and CI/CD workflows. Importantly, we want to find someone that is _opinionated_ **** about different approaches in this area (What do you think about serverless? And what about GitOps? When is Kubernetes overkill?).

 **Other nice-to-haves are:**

  * Very robust technical communication skills, preferably with experience in a remote and primarily asynchronous work environment.

  * Working in a time zone that roughly matches EU or US East Coast hours.

  * Experience with cloud infrastructure, Kubernetes and designing medium to large scale architectures for data processing.

  * Has spent a long time (5+ years) working on production software in either Golang, Rust, Python, or Node.js.

##  **About Neon**

Neon is building open-source cloud-native PostgreSQL. Our architecture separates storage from compute, allowing for stateless and serverless Postgres. We’re a well-funded startup with deep knowledge of Postgres internals and decades of experience building databases. We are a systems company; we work on low-level code with strict performance and correctness requirements.

Neon was created by a team of Postgres hackers and led by CEO Nikita Shamgunov (co-founder of SingleStore). Neon is built on open-source principles and is focused on giving back to the Postgres and developer communities.

 **Our Team**

  * We are a distributed team of 120+ people working from 25+ countries (concentrating around North American and European time zones)

  * We are a team built on open source cultural principles (transparency, contribution, accountability, proactivity)

  * Team with decades of experience building databases and deep knowledge of Postgres internals. We are deeply technical

  * We have experienced Postgres committers and hackers on the team (check Heikki, Anastasia, Arseny, Matthias profiles)

  * We believe in the efficacy of collaborative open-source

  * We aim for a diversity of thoughts and backgrounds

  * We are keen to be a fast-moving, flat org and avoid hierarchical structures

##  **Our Investors**

  * Top-tier investors backed up Neon's vision:

    * We raised $104+ million in funding from Menlo Ventures, Notable Capital, Khosla Ventures, General Catalyst, and Founders Fund.

    * Venture vehicles of Snowflake and Databricks invested in Neon.

    * Our angel investors are prominent technologists and ecosystem players. More than 20 awesome angels supported Neon, including Nat Friedman, Elad Gil, Mike Ovitz, Ajeet Singh, Guillermo Rauch, Søren Brammer Schmidt, and Wes McKinney.

    * Our Board includes Quentin Clark, Glenn Solomon, Joe Morrissey, and Tim Tully.

##  **Our Offer**

  * You have an opportunity to be an early employee in the fast-scaling, ambitious team

  * You can work 100% remotely: we'll handle all formalities to arrange work from your home

  * We grant equity (stock options) to all full-time hires

  * We offer a competitive benefits package in line with all tech companies (top-notch equipment, unlimited vacations, paid parental leaves, and much more)

  * We are distributed, yet make our bonds during regular offsites (the last one was in Lisbon, Portugal)
