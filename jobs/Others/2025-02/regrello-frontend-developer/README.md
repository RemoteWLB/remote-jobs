 **Company**

Regrello is a 60-person startup revolutionizing how the world’s most critical enterprises operate. Born out of the White House COVID Task Force in 2020 and backed by Andreessen Horowitz, Tiger Global, and Ram Sriram (first investor in Google), we're reimagining automation in supply chains—in which companies still communicate about $13T of annual shipments almost entirely via email—as well as in manufacturing and operations. This is a $220-billion market opportunity that’s been largely overlooked for over 20 years. Four years in, we're already powering pivotal enterprise use cases in multiple industries to a degree that is unheard of for companies at our phase, and we're actively growing to new enterprises in the USA, Europe, and Asia. Our team has experience building billion-dollar companies and includes veterans from Oracle, Palantir, Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft.

 **Product**

We’re building the AI-first ERP to replace decades-old giants like SAP and Oracle, transforming how enterprises operate. Our platform can generate any enterprise workflow application in minutes—a dramatic leap from the 1-2 years it traditionally takes IT teams to build them—giving process owners in supply chain, manufacturing, and operations the power to standardize, streamline, and drive their work to completion, no matter the complexity. This breakthrough is powered by our workflow, forms, and AI engines, as well as our in-house Large Tabular Model, a first-of-its-kind innovation. Customers aren’t just adopting our platform—they’re clamoring for more, rapidly expanding their use cases as we enter an exhilarating growth phase. As one user put it: “I’ve been waiting for this for 20 years.”

 **Role**

Regrello is looking for stellar Software Engineers (mid-level, and senior) with a hunger to build and a passion for solving complex global problems. A frontend visionary, in this role, you will design, develop, and maintain robust solutions using React, TypeScript, collaborating with a diverse and talented team. You’ll drive projects from inception to launch, engage in thought-provoking architectural discussions, and have direct access to users and industry experts to deliver software that truly makes a difference. This is an individual-contributor role with the potential for advancement in the future.

 **Requirements**

A builder at heart—you thrive on solving hard problems and get so deeply engaged in the process that time flies when you're in your editor.

8 years of industry experience as a Software Engineer building user-facing web applications (we’ll give you a Senior title if your experience warrants it).

Fluency in frontend

Track record of shipping complex software projects, whether personal or professional

Excellent written and verbal communication skills, capable of articulating complex technical concepts to diverse audiences.

Strong desire to learn, grow, and drive impact on real global problems—and to help others around you do the same.

 **Responsibilities**

Collaborate with cross-functional teams including Design, Product Management, and industry experts to build high-quality product features.

Take on new challenges and responsibilities as needed, and be an enthusiastic team player in a dynamic startup environment.
