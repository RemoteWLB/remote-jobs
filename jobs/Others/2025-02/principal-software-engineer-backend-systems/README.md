This breakthrough is made possible by their workflow, forms, and AI engines, as well as a proprietary Large Tabular Model. Customers are not only adopting the platform but rapidly expanding their use cases as the company enters a thrilling growth phase. As one user put it: “I’ve been waiting for this for 20 years.”
