In this role, you will design, develop, and maintain robust full-stack solutions using React, TypeScript, Go, and SQL, collaborating with a diverse and talented team. You’ll drive projects from inception to launch, engage in thought-provoking architectural discussions, and have direct access to users and industry experts to deliver software that truly makes a difference. This is an individual contributor role with potential for advancement in the future.

 **About the Company**

Our client is a rapidly growing startup revolutionizing how global enterprises operate. Founded in 2020 during the White House COVID Task Force initiative and backed by top-tier investors, this company is reimagining automation in supply chains, manufacturing, and operations. In a $220 billion market that has been largely overlooked for over 20 years, they are building solutions to replace outdated manual processes and improve efficiency at an unprecedented scale. After just four years, the company is already enabling critical enterprise use cases across multiple industries and is rapidly expanding in the U.S., Europe, and Asia. Their team includes experienced professionals from companies like Oracle, Palantir, Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft.

 **The Product**

This company is building a next-generation AI-powered ERP to replace legacy giants like SAP and Oracle, transforming enterprise operations. Their platform enables the creation of any enterprise workflow application in minutes—a dramatic improvement over the traditional 1-2 years required for IT teams to develop them. This gives process owners in supply chain, manufacturing, and operations the ability to standardize, optimize, and drive their work to completion, regardless of complexity. Their breakthrough technology is powered by workflow automation, forms, AI engines, and a proprietary Large Tabular Model. Customers are not just adopting the platform—they are expanding their use cases rapidly as the company enters an exciting growth phase. As one user stated, “I’ve been waiting for this for 20 years.”

 **Culture and Compensation**

This company is a customer-obsessed, product-driven organization that fosters a flexible, hybrid/remote work culture to attract top talent. This position is **on-site** in **San Francisco, Seattle, Austin, or New York**. The compensation package is highly competitive, including salary, equity, and health benefits. Visa sponsorship for U.S. work authorization is available if needed.

  * Passion for building and solving complex problems—you thrive in a fast-paced environment and get deeply engaged in the process.

  * B.S. in Computer Science or a related field, with a **3.5+ GPA** for recent grads (M.S. is a plus).

  * 0-8 years of experience as a Software Engineer developing user-facing web applications (senior title available for experienced candidates).

  * Eagerness to learn, grow, and make a meaningful impact on global challenges—while also helping those around you do the same.
