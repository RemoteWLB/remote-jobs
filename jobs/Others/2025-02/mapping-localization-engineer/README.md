####  

At Serve Robotics, we’re reimagining how things move in cities. Our personable sidewalk robot is our vision for the future. It’s designed to take deliveries away from congested streets, make deliveries available to more people, and benefit local businesses. The Serve fleet has been delighting merchants, customers, and pedestrians along the way in Los Angeles while doing commercial deliveries.

The Serve fleet has been delighting merchants, customers, and pedestrians along the way in Los Angeles while doing commercial deliveries. We’re looking for talented individuals who will grow robotic deliveries from surprising novelty to efficient ubiquity.

###  **Who We Are**

We are tech industry veterans in software, hardware, and design who are pooling our skills to build the future we want to live in. We are solving real-world problems leveraging robotics, machine learning and computer vision, among other disciplines, with a mindful eye towards the end-to-end user experience. Our team is agile, diverse, and driven. We believe that the best way to solve complicated dynamic problems is collaboratively and respectfully.

 **What you'll be doing**

There's undeniable demand for cheap, fast and reliable deliveries (pick all three!) across all delivery companies, restaurant chains and individual restaurants.

We want Serve to help all of them. To accomplish this, Serve needs autonomous driving and routing capabilities built on top of robust, scalable maps, as well as high quality real-time localization to make use of these maps. We are a small but highly capable team, so the impact of your work will be considerable.

 **Responsibilities**

  * Design and implement core pieces of our next generation mapping and localization engine.

  * Contribute to a mapping system that scales to city-size environments while preserving high resolution geometry to aid navigation in tight quarters.

  * Collaborate to improve map annotation tooling and consumption of data by neural network based approaches for safe traversable area navigation.

  * Contribute to flexible location estimation fusing relative and absolute measurements.

  * Work closely with other autonomy team members to maximize the utility provided by mapping and localization.

  * Ship production quality code, participate in code reviews, teach / mentor more junior engineers.

 **Qualifications**

  * Bachelor’s degree in Robotics focused in localization and mapping and 2+ years of industry experience.

  * Experience building SLAM systems in production

  * Strong C++ programming skills.

  * Experience designing and building a simple system that works, and having it gradually evolve into a elegant system that scales.

  * Strong verbal and writing communication skills.

 **What’s makes you standout**

  * PhD in Robotics focused in localization and mapping.

  * Experience building cloud applications

  * Building infrastructure for labeling and maintaining HD maps

  * Experience with very large geospatial datasets

  * Experience with CUDA programming

  * Experience with real sensors, such as lidar, camera, RGB-D, etc.
