**About the Job:**

LaunchDarkly is looking for an experienced Frontend Engineer to play a key role in building a new product line on the Error Monitoring & Session Replay team. You’ll be part of the Release Observability pillar, which is focused on making every release safer, faster, and more reliable. Our mission is to redefine how software is released: automating release processes, measuring the real-time impact of feature rollouts, and simplifying debugging when things go wrong. From automated release pipelines to metrics monitoring, error tracking, and fully automated rollbacks, our work ensures every code change is measured, and the entire release process from rollout to issue mitigation is managed for maximum efficiency and reliability.

As a member of Error Monitoring & Session Replay team, you’ll be helping us harness the power of LaunchDarkly’s SDKs to automatically track errors in customers' applications, aggregate them to measure user impact, and use them to make smart decisions about releases.

If you’re interested in building the systems that help software teams ship safely at scale, we’d love to work with you.

  *  **Collaborate seamlessly with cross-functional partners** (product, design, data science, and engineering) to architect and advance our error monitoring and session replay products. Leverage your broad experience to facilitate strategic discussions that align technical solutions with business goals, ensuring the delivery of scalable and effective features.

  *  **Drive comprehensive end-to-end feature development** , taking full ownership from proof of concept through to delivery. Ensure that each feature provides robust observability into system behavior and customer usage patterns post-launch, applying a deep understanding of both technical and user experience considerations to optimize feature performance and reliability.

  *  **Proactively identify opportunities for product and user experience improvements** , leveraging data insights and feedback to propose innovative, well-reasoned solutions. Lead the implementation of these enhancements, balancing user needs, business goals, and technical feasibility, ensuring each change drives meaningful improvements in engagement and performance.

  *  **Provide expert mentorship and support to teammates** , guiding them through complex challenges and fostering a collaborative, high-performance environment. Your deep expertise will help accelerate their growth, elevate team standards, and enhance overall productivity and technical excellence.

  *  **Actively lead and contribute to code reviews, spec reviews, and architecture design** , ensuring alignment with best practices, long-term scalability, and maintainability. Your experience will drive thorough and thoughtful evaluation of solutions, while providing constructive feedback that elevates the quality of the codebase.

  *  **Play a key role in advancing engineering standards, tooling, and processes** across the technology organization. By identifying areas for improvement and implementing process innovations, you will shape a more efficient and effective development environment, empowering teams to deliver high-quality features faster.

  *  **Stay at the forefront of frontend development trends, experimentation, and data-driven product evolution** , bringing deep expertise to suggest and implement forward-thinking improvements in tools, processes, and methodologies. Your proactive involvement in continuous learning and improvement will help ensure the team remains competitive and cutting-edge in its approach to building user-focused products.
