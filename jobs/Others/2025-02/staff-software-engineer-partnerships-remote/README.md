We believe that mental health is just as important as physical health. We recognize that mental health issues can be complex and multifaceted, and we are dedicated to treating the whole person, not just the symptoms.

We aim to create a world where mental health is no longer stigmatized or marginalized, but rather is embraced as an integral part of one's overall well-being.

We believe that by providing quality care that is both evidence-based and compassionate, we can empower individuals to take charge of their mental health and achieve their full potential. We are passionate about making a positive impact on the lives of those struggling with mental health issues and we strive to be a force for positive change in the field of mental healthcare.

 **About the Role**

We’re looking for a Staff Software Engineer to join our Partnerships Core engineering team and help us build out our Partnerships platform focusing on standard integrations for Payers, PCPs, and Health Systems. In this role, you’ll design and build scalable systems that provide data and services within Rula and across our partners, ensuring the Partnerships platform remains reliable, maintainable, and ready for future growth. As a technical leader, you’ll drive architectural decisions, mentor team members, and play a critical role in shaping the systems that enable Rula to deliver mental health care to our partners’ members.
