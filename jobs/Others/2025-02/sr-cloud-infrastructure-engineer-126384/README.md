###  **Who We Are**

We are tech industry veterans in software, hardware, and design who are pooling our skills to build the future we want to live in. We are solving real-world problems leveraging robotics, machine learning and computer vision, among other disciplines, with a mindful eye towards the end-to-end user experience. Our team is agile, diverse, and driven. We believe that the best way to solve complicated dynamic problems is collaboratively and respectfully.

As a **Cloud Infrastructure Engineer** , you will be the driving force behind automating our cloud solutions. You will create and maintain infrastructure-as-code templates, refine processes, and keep our technology stack at the forefront of best practices in an ever-evolving cloud landscape. A key responsibility will be ensuring our automation seamlessly serves both development and production environments while optimizing costs and resource usage.

 **Responsibilities**

 **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**

  * Develop and maintain our cloud infrastructure using tools like Terraform.

  * Design reusable, version-controlled configurations that enable rapid deployment and easy maintenance.

 **Hands-On Automation**

  * Implement and own automated processes for provisioning, scaling, disaster recovery, and routine updates.

  * Ensure minimal manual intervention through effective tooling and scripting (Python, Go, Bash, etc.).

 **Technical Leadership (Non-Managerial)**

  * Drive cloud-related initiatives across the company, providing technical expertise and thought leadership.

  * Collaborate with cross-functional teams (e.g., security, product, SRE) to ensure alignment on infrastructure goals.

  * Advocate for best practices and make strategic recommendations on evolving our cloud environment.

 **Monitoring & Alerting**

  * Deploy and refine observability solutions—metrics, logs, tracing—to maintain high availability and expedite incident response.

  * Proactively tune monitoring systems to identify issues before they escalate.

 **Resource Management & Cost Optimization**

  * Implement strategies to retire or scale down unused resources, reducing operational costs.

  * Collaborate with stakeholders to track and allocate cloud spending at a granular level, ensuring transparency.

 **Security & Compliance**

  * Integrate security best practices into infrastructure designs, in partnership with security teams.

  * Conduct periodic reviews to ensure alignment with internal policies and relevant regulatory requirements.

 **Continuous Improvement**

  * Stay informed about emerging cloud technologies and assess their potential impact on our organization.

  * Propose and champion updates or migrations that enhance the robustness, scalability, and efficiency of our systems.

 **Qualifications**

 **Experience & Background**

  * 5+ years of hands-on experience in cloud infrastructure engineering, DevOps, or a related field.

  * Proven track record managing production-grade environments and leading technical initiatives without direct reports.

 **Technical Skills**

  *  **Cloud Platforms** : Proficiency with GCP, AWS, or Azure, including designing and operating highly available systems.

  *  **IaC Tools** : Expertise with Terraform, Ansible, or equivalent for automated environment provisioning and management.

  *  **Containers & Orchestration**: Familiarity with Docker and Kubernetes (or similar) for application packaging and deployment.

  *  **Scripting & Automation**: Skilled in Python, Go, Bash, or other relevant languages.

  *  **Cost Management** : Practical knowledge of monitoring and optimizing cloud expenditures.

 **Soft Skills**

  *  **Communication** : Adept at conveying technical concepts to both technical and non-technical audiences.

  *  **Initiative & Ownership**: Able to work autonomously, owning projects from ideation to production.

  *  **Collaborative Spirit** : Able to coordinate with diverse teams, influencing architecture decisions and best practices.

 **Education**

  * Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or a related field (or equivalent experience).

 **What Makes You Stand Out**

  *  **Geo-Distributed Experience** : Skilled in designing infrastructure for multiple regions, enhancing resilience and performance.

  *  **Forward-Thinking** : Consistently researching and experimenting with new cloud tools and services, anticipating future needs.

  *  **Project Leadership** : Demonstrated success rolling out large-scale infrastructure changes or migrations independently.

  *  **Mentorship & Knowledge Sharing**: While you won’t directly manage others, you excel at guiding peers and promoting best practices across the organization.
