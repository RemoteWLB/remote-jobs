\-------------------------------

At Paradox, we are convinced that people do not want “just a job” anymore.

We are all craving to have an impact through our professional journey. Some want to start their own venture, some want to become an intrapreneur in their current organization, some others just want their day-to-day tasks to have more meaning.

 **🎯 PARADOX HAS ONE GOAL: TO EMPOWER PEOPLE AND ORGANIZATIONS TO LIVE THEIR TRUE AMBITIONS.**

But where do we start?

If you have an interest in personal development, you probably already know that:

  * Making things happen is a real struggle when you don’t know what truly inspires you and how to get there ;

  * Available resources are either boring 😴 or full of crazy unsubstantiated theories 🤪.

It needs to change, and we’re here to make it happen!

 **⭐️ OUR AMBITION IS TO MAKE SUCCESS THE ONLY POSSIBLE OUTCOME FOR OUR CLIENTS (WHATEVER SUCCESS MEANS FOR THEM), BY CRAFTING INNOVATIVE & CAPTIVATING BREAKTHROUGH EXPERIENCES.**

In other words, we want to make personal growth **as entertaining as watching Netflix.**

How, you might be wondering?

  * We travel the world and surround ourselves with **top entrepreneurs** _(Richard Branson - Founder of Virgin, Marc Simoncini - Founder of Meeting, Fred Mazzella - Founder of BlablaCar)_ , **world** **athletes** _(Tony Parker - Hall of fame NBA Player, Frederick Bousquet - World record in 50m free swimming, Frank Leboeuf - WorldCup Footballer)_ , and **artists** _(Gad Elmaleh - Comedian, Franck Dubosc, Barry Osborne - Producer of Lord of the Rings and Matrix)_ ✊;

  * We reverse engineer their **strategies for achieving success** and fulfillment and lean on the **latest researches** about neurosciences ⚙️;

  * We deliver trainings & educational contents around Power Skills (critical thinking, productivity, leadership, public speaking, coaching, stress management, etc.), **self-growth and performance** , through a balanced set of **e-learning programs, events and edutainment videos** 💡.

From one well-known Founder to a team of +45 people today (and counting!), this approach has paid off and enabled us to exceed 2 million followers on social networks, and to have thousands of people attending our online events and training courses.

 **🔥 TOGETHER, WE ARE DRIVEN BY ONE DREAM:**

  1. Helping 100 000 people achieve their dream and display their pictures on what we call the “100 000 dreams wall” ;

  2. Giving our clients access to constant personal growth by reinventing their learning experience ;

  3. Leverage AI and other technology to provide an outstanding customized experience to millions of people for them to transform their lives.
