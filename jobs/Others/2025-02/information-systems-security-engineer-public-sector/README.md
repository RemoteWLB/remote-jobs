  * Exceptional technical program management skills, with the ability to multitask and deliver large complex programs under pressure.

This role is based in Washington, DC. We use a hybrid work model of 3 days in the office per week and offer relocation assistance to new employees.

  * Create clear, concise, and technically accurate documentation, including System Security Plans (SSPs), risk assessments, and architecture diagrams.

  * Act as a subject matter expert during audits and assessments, representing the organization with credibility and expertise.

  * Continuously refine processes to improve the efficiency and quality of compliance efforts.

 **You might thrive in this role if you have:**

  * An active US security clearance.

  * 5+ years of compliance experience in positions involving information security, data security, or infrastructure or network security. 

  * Familiarity with deployment models, including to cloud platforms (Azure, AWS) and the underlying infrastructure primitives (Kubernetes, Terraform).

  * Strong familiarity with core security concepts and technologies, such as authentication, encryption, vulnerability management, and audit logging.
