In less than 6 months, Vitalize has **reached 7-figures in ARR** and is backed by top investors, including Y Combinator and top health systems.

We are a small team of published healthcare researchers, college and grad school dropouts, former McKinsey consultants, former US math champions, and previous VC-backed founders.
