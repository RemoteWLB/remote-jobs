Parkade's mission is to reshape cities and combat climate change by creating a world not just with far less parking, but one where it's a lot easier to park. Hundreds of existing customers love Parkade, and investors do, too — they just funded our Series A. We're now ready to get Parkade into every apartment, condo, and office building and to do that, we need you.

We are seeking a skilled React Native Engineer with a strong interest and background in front-end web development.

You will join a small (but mighty!) team that is improving how buildings and cities utilize space by making it possible for them to share unused parking. You are a collaborator and partner in building an app that is beautiful and powerful, inside and out. You will partner closely with the Engineering, Product, and Design teams to help build our iOS and Android apps, which are built on top of React Native. The mostly untapped private parking industry offers immense potential for growth, development, and significant impact.

###

**We’re looking for someone who will:**

  * Build high quality software with an eye for making it easier for yourself (and future hires) to code/test/deploy the app

  * Make great decisions about architecture and libraries that are informed by mistakes you’ve made in the past

  * Care deeply about the product and user experience you’re delivering, advocate for what you believe in, and then commit and build whatever the team decides

  * Roll up your sleeves and proactively jump into projects or challenges that you identify

 **Things you have done:**

  * Spent 3-5 years doing front-end work

  * Spent 1+ year doing React Native work

  * Worked in a startup environment, ideally on a small/distributed team

  * You’re an expert at front end technologies like JavaScript, CSS, React, and related tooling (npm, yarn, jest, eslint, etc.)

  * You care about the latest ECMAScript and browser standards and follow new developments with nerdy intensity

  * You’ve worked on an app that is in the App Store / Google Play

  * Even if you’re not an expert in iOS / Android, you can hack together some native modules when needed

 **Things that would make you stand out:**

  * You have experience in native mobile development, either iOS with objc/Swift or Android with Java/Kotlin.

  * You are proficient with Python or a similar language not used on the front end.

  * You have experience working on deploying backend services to AWS or Google Cloud.

  * You have experience setting up CI/CD infrastructure from scratch.

  * You have built something from the ground up before

  * You care about problems related to parking and efficient use of space and resources in cities

 **What you get in return:**

  * Meaningful equity in a Series A company

  * Competitive compensation

  * As one of our early employees, you have the chance to put your mark on a product and company from its early days

  * Freedom in your work; we don’t spend a lot of time in meetings or on unnecessary processes

 **Regarding Location:**

We're a hybrid team with about half the company (including our Engineering team) working out of our San Francisco office. We generally have a preference to hire candidates located in/near San Francisco who are willing to be in our office regularly, but know it's a competitive market, and we are open to this role being remote in the US.
