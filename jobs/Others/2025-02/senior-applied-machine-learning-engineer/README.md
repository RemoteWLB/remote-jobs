At Vanta, our mission is to secure the internet and protect consumer data. We believe that security should be monitored and verified continuously, and we empower companies to practice better security and prove it with ease. Vanta has a kind and talented team, and while some have prior security experience, many have been successful at Vanta without it.

As an applied machine learning engineer at Vanta, you will play a crucial role in shaping Vanta’s AI offerings, improving the performance of our AI systems, and setting technical strategy for our end to end ML/AI architecture. You’ll form the core AI team around which many AI applications will be built and shipped.

The AI team aims to revolutionize the operation of security and compliance programs. We are doing so by streamlining the tedious Q&A process in security reviews and arming our users with actionable insights based on their business context and vanta’s subject matter expertise.

As a Senior Applied Machine Learning Engineer, you will be working alongside a multidisciplinary group of Product engineers, other MLEs, PMs, and security and compliance experts to implement, scale, and maintain ML pipelines to provide value to our users.

We are excited to be developing a groundbreaking product, and you should be too!

 **How to be successful in this role:**

  * You are a strong coder.

  * You have experience building ML systems from ground up, shipping ML solutions to production, and owning the full ML development lifecycle.

  * Expertise in building, deploying and maintaining LLM-based applications in productions: embeddings, RAG, Agent, prompt engineering, and fine tuning.

  * Strong understanding of data preprocessing, feature engineering, model evaluation techniques, and quality hill-climbing.

  * Strong written and verbal communication skills.

  * Strong analytical skills is a plus.

 **About Vanta**

We started in 2018, in the wake of several high-profile data breaches. Online security was only becoming more important, but we knew firsthand how hard it could be for fast-growing companies to invest the time and manpower it takes to build a solid security foundation. Vanta was inspired by a vision to restore trust in internet businesses by enabling companies to improve and prove their security.From our early days automating security monitoring for compliance standards like SOC 2, HIPAA and ISO 27001 to creating the world's leading Trust Management Platform, our vision remains unchanged.

Now more than ever, making security continuous—not just a point-in-time check— is essential. Thousands of companies rely on Vanta to build, maintain and demonstrate their trust— all in a way that's real-time and transparent.
