At Vanta, our mission is to secure the internet and protect consumer data. We believe that security should be monitored and verified continuously, and we empower companies to practice better security and prove it with ease. Vanta has a kind and talented team, and while some have prior security experience, many have been successful at Vanta without it.

Our Frontend Engineers own and drive high-impact, user-facing projects at a hypergrowth company that has found product-market fit and is scaling quickly.

At Vanta, you’ll leverage your expertise of best-in-class web technologies and tools, improving our frontend web architecture and sharing these best practices with the team.

Today, joining Vanta as an engineer means seeing all parts of the business, growing and developing our team, shaping Vanta's culture from the earliest stages, and building core parts of our product and infrastructure that enable us to continue to grow and scale.

No security experience is required, just a passion for our mission to secure the internet and protect consumer data!

 **About Vanta**

We started in 2018, in the wake of several high-profile data breaches. Online security was only becoming more important, but we knew firsthand how hard it could be for fast-growing companies to invest the time and manpower it takes to build a solid security foundation. Vanta was inspired by a vision to restore trust in internet businesses by enabling companies to improve and prove their security.From our early days automating security monitoring for compliance standards like SOC 2, HIPAA and ISO 27001 to creating the world's leading Trust Management Platform, our vision remains unchanged.

Now more than ever, making security continuous—not just a point-in-time check— is essential. Thousands of companies rely on Vanta to build, maintain and demonstrate their trust— all in a way that's real-time and transparent.
