### Role & missions – What you will do 🚀

You will work with other engineers on our low latency and highly scalable Java backend, ensuring it always stays up. The Java backend is a core component for our LiveOps and UAM solutions, so you will participate with multi-disciplinary teams to make decisions about our future products and services.

### Our Culture—Who we are🪐

At Homa, we value brains over backgrounds and determination over degrees. We believe actual growth results from diversity — nationalities, backgrounds, skill sets, and personal experiences — all working towards a single objective. If you’ve got the smarts, energy, and motivation, no barriers keep you from going far.

We are the people behind the platform - the creative specialists giving creators the data needed to power up their creativity. At Homa, we live by the three central values:

  * Ambition: we put flags on summits. We set our goals ambitiously high and don’t shy away from the climb. We’re on a mission to take over an industry thick with incumbents who won’t go quietly into the night. To succeed here, you’ll need a highly metaphorical shield and a sword.

  * Humility: we put our egos aside. We put our hands up. First to volunteer to help, second to high-five. Having an ego is natural, but letting it run the show is unhelpful to everyone. In the words of Mr. Lamar: Sit down. Be humble.
  * Curiosity: we keep our eyes open. We believe the best way to know anything is to question everything. And to do that, you need open eyes and open minds at all times.

### Benefits

  * While success is its own reward, here are some of the benefits that come with working at Homa:
    * We offer essential benefits in France and specific locations, including health insurance, meal vouchers, public transport subsidies, childcare benefits, and life insurance
    * If you're interested in working from our newly renovated Paris HQ with a rooftop garden and WeWork amenities, we have a desk waiting for you
    * You will be working in English with our international team of top-tier talents from 35+ countries
    * You will be able to attend diverse team events and Workations (the famous company-wide Homa trip)
    * You will have quarterly reviews to help you grow within Homa and build your own career path.
