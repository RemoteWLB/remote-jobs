At Netflix, our mission is to entertain the world. With 200+ million paid members in over 190 countries on millions of devices; enjoying TV series, documentaries, and feature films across a wide variety of genres and languages - Netflix is reinventing entertainment from end to end. We are revolutionizing how shows and movies are produced, pushing technological boundaries to efficiently deliver streaming video at a massive scale over the internet, and continuously improving the end-to-end user experience with Netflix across their member journey.

We pride ourselves on using data to inform our decision-making as we work towards our mission. This requires curating data across various domains such as Growth, Finance, Product, Content, and Studio. All of this data collection and curation is made possible thanks to the amazing Data Engineers of Netflix who bring this data to life.

Data Engineering at Netflix is a role that requires building systems to process data efficiently and modeling the data to power analytics. These solutions can range from batch data pipelines that bring to life business metrics to real-time processing services that integrate with our core product features. In addition, we require our Data Engineers to have a rich understanding of large distributed systems on which our data solutions rely. Candidates should have knowledge across several of these skill sets and usually need to be deep in at least one. As a Data Engineer, you also need to have strong communication skills since you will need to collaborate with business, engineering, and data science teams to enable a culture of learning.
