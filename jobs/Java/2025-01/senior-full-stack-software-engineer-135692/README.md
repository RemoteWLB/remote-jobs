Did you know? Research indicates men often apply for jobs if they meet just 60% of the criteria, but women and other underrepresented groups usually wait until they check every box. Let's change this pattern! If you see yourself fitting into this role, even without ticking all the boxes, we'd love to hear from you. At Orum, we value diverse perspectives and are excited to consider how your unique skills could contribute to our team's success.
