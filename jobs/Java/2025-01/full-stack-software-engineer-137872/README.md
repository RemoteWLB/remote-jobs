## Description

About the company

  

Kodex creates software that helps private companies handle lawful data requests from governments. Our founders have seen firsthand how difficult it is for public and private sectors to collaborate effectively‚Äìpreventing real-world harm while respecting user privacy. Slow processes, clunky tools, and misuse by bad actors were common problems. Kodex was built to fix that.

  

Our platform streamlines case management for Law Enforcement Response and Trust & Safety teams. It combines secure workflows, communication, and file transfers with features like document encryption, audit trails, agency verification, account takeover detection, and API integrations‚Äîdelivering a complete legal response solution.

  

Founded in 2021 and backed by Y Combinator and Andreessen Horowitz, Kodex helps companies securely and efficiently respond to data requests on time.

  

About the role

  

We‚Äôre seeking an experienced Full Stack Software Engineer to join our growing team and help build the cornerstone of our business: our Law Enforcement Response portal. Kodex is an early stage startup so each engineer wears multiple hats. You will work as part of a small, talented team that includes engineers with experience at successful companies like Medium, HashiCorp, Microsoft, Mozilla, Meta, and Uber.

  

This role is ideal for full-stack generalists with T-shaped skills who thrive in fast-paced environments and enjoy taking ownership.
