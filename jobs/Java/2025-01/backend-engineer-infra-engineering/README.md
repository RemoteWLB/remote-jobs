**Who we are is what we do.**

Deel and our family of growing companies are made up of global teams dedicated to helping businesses hire anyone, anywhere, easily.

The team comprises over three thousand self-driven individuals spanning over 100 countries, and our unified yet diverse culture keeps us continually learning and innovating the platform and products for customers.

Companies should be able to hire the best talent anywhere in the world, so we are building the best platform to make that a reality. Our market-leading technology, expertise, and global team are crucial to the platform’s success. We deliver the best products and features in our space, enabling millions of jobs worldwide and connecting the global workforce with the best companies and opportunities.

 **Why should you be part of our success story?**

A 30-mile hiring radius should no longer dictate how companies hire because exceptional talent lives everywhere. Deel sees a world without hiring borders and endless talent that pairs perfect candidates with great companies.

We offer global teams all the tools they need to hire, onboard, manage, pay, and scale at full speed. We aim to foster a diverse global economy by building a generational platform that seamlessly connects companies with talent worldwide.

After our successful Series D in 2021, we raised another $50M in 2023, doubling our valuation to $12B. There’s never been a more exciting time to join Deel — the international payroll and compliance market leader.

 **What does the Infra Engineering team do?**

Our team was created to support Deel engineering growth and build a platform for product teams, so they could ship business value faster. Deel is at a very unique position because we are big enough that we need the platform but we are young enough to not have it yet. There is a dedicated DevOps team and they take care of the infrastructure, while we work on the edge between devops and engineering enforcing standards and best practices, creating tooling, maintaining internal libraries, providing architectural guidance and owning some high-loaded core services and responding to production incidents when needed. It’s 65% engineering and 35% devops. We have a lot of freedom, but it comes with responsibility.

 **Who we are looking for?**

  * 5+ years of experience as a Back-End Engineer

  * Kubernetes, Helm and Docker knowledge

  * Experience with Node.js, Postgres/Mysql, RabbitMq/Nats/Kafka

  * Experience with Infrastructure, observability/monitoring tools

  * Strong system design and problem solving skills, we often deal with the “unknown”

  * Experience in building CI/CD pipelines

  * Nice if you have experience building Internal Developer Platforms and tooling

  * You are hands-on troubleshooter

  * Strong communication skills, we often need to orchestrate projects with 10+ teams

  * You are ready for challenges

 **Total Rewards**

Our workforce deserves fair and competitive pay that meets them where they are. With scalable benefits, rewards, and perks, our total rewards programs reflect our commitment to inclusivity and access for all.

**Some things you’ll enjoy**

  * Provided computer equipment tailored to your role

  * Stock grant opportunities dependent on your role, employment status and location

  * Additional perks and benefits based on your employment status and country

  * The flexibility of remote work, including WeWork access where available
