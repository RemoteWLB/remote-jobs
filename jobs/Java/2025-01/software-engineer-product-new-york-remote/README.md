### Key Responsibilities:

*  **Work across the entire stack** , from React to Node.Js to PostgreSQL.
*  **Plan, shape and build** new features and enhancements.
*  **Understand banks and their customers** , and every financial service from deposit accounts to loans to treasury services.
*  **Deliver a platform** that is accessible, reliable, scalable and optimized for banks and their customers across the world. 

  

### Qualifications:

*  **Thoughtful problem-solving** : For you, problem-solving starts with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You can decompose tricky problems and work towards a clean solution, by yourself or with teammates. You're comfortable asking for help when you get stuck.
*  **Pragmatism and impact-orientation** : You care about business impact and prioritize projects accordingly. You're not just going after cool stuffâ€”you understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line.
*  **Putting users first** : You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impactâ€”good and bad.
*  **Empathetic communication** : You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed.
*  **Team player** : For you, work isn't a solo endeavor. You enjoy collaborating cross-functionally to accomplish shared goals, and you care about learning, growing, and helping others to do the same.
