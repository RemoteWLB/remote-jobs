# About One

One’s mission is simple - to help customers achieve financial progress. We’re doing this by creating simple solutions to help our customers save, spend, borrow, and grow their money – all in one place.

The U.S. consumer today deserves better. Millions of Americans today can’t access credit, build savings or wealth, and are left to manage their financial lives through multiple disconnected apps. Almost a quarter of U.S. adults are unbanked or underbanked and roughly 80% of fintech users rely on multiple accounts to manage their finances.

What makes us unique? We are backed by a preeminent fintech investor (Ribbit) and the world’s largest retailer (Walmart), maintain the speed and independence of a startup, and employ a strong (and growing) collection of world-class talent.

There’s never been a better moment to build a business that helps people achieve financial progress. Come build with us!

## The Role

Software engineers on One’s Spend team build and maintain features that involve spending with your One Debit Card. Services the team is responsible for include transaction enrichment, physical & virtual card management, cashback, third-party integrations and more! Software Engineers at One are highly technical, communicative, and emotionally intelligent.

  * Architect, design, and implement software applications for banking products, ensuring scalability, performance, and reliability. 

  * Net new feature development 0->1 

  * Build and maintain documentation. As a growing and remote organization, having the necessary docs are key to our success. 

  * Solve complex problems that arise at scale. We deal with real-world money movement, sensitive financial data at scale, and are creating novel financial mechanics with no real precedent.  

# You bring

  * Experience working in a high-scale banking or fintech organization

  * Professional experience building, shipping — and growing customer-facing products

  * Knowledge of banking protocols, API’s, and security standards

  * Deep understanding of event-driven architecture and microservices

  * Solid understanding of banking systems, financial transactions, and payment processing

  * Experience leading, mentoring, and demonstrating excellence in execution. You need little oversight when given a problem to solve, and you have a track record of getting things done.

  * Passion for your craft and care for the people you work with. You value quality across code, communication, and culture.

  * A desire to keep growing your skills, and an ability to learn quickly. We hope you’ll be here for a while, and there’s no better investment than in our people.

  * The Triple H Factor: Hungry, Humble, Honest

## Tools we use

We use the fp-ts library for functional programming with Node/TypeScript running on top of Kubernetes and AWS. We believe great engineers can learn any stack, so you **do not need experience** with these specific tools, but you’ll ramp up more quickly if you are familiar with functional programming concepts.

## Pay Transparency

The estimated annual base salary for this position ranges from $165,000 to $220,000. Pay is generally based upon the level, complexity, responsibility, and job duties/requirements of the specific position. We then source candidates with the requisite skills, expertise, education, training, and experience. If you are selected for an interview, please feel welcome to speak to a Talent Partner about our compensation philosophy and other available benefits.

## What it's like working @ One

  * Competitive cash

  * Benefits effective on day one

  * Early access to a high potential, high growth fintech

  * Generous stock option packages in an early-stage startup

  * Remote friendly (anywhere in the US) and office friendly - you pick the schedule

  * Flexible time off programs - vacation, sick, paid parental leave, and paid caregiver leave

  * 401(k) plan with match

  

We use Covey as part of our hiring process for jobs in NYC and certain features may qualify it as an AEDT. As part of the evaluation process we provide Covey with job requirements and candidate submitted applications. We began using Covey Scout for Inbound on May 31, 2024.

# Leveling Philosophy

In order to thoughtfully scale the company and avoid downstream inequities, we’ve adopted a flat titling structure at One. Though we may occasionally post a role externally with a prefix such as “Senior” to reflect the external level of the position, we do not use prefixes in titles like that internally unless in a position which manages a team. Internal titles typically include your specific functional responsibility, such as engineering, product management or sales, and often include additional descriptors to ensure clarity of role and placement within our organization (i.e. “Engineer, Platform”, “Sales, Business Development” or “Manager, Talent”). Employees are paid commensurate with their experience and the internal level within One.

# Inclusion & Belonging

To build technology and products that are used and loved by people and solve real-world problems, we need to build a team with many different perspectives and experiences. We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status. We encourage candidates from all backgrounds to apply. Applicants in need of special assistance or accommodation during the interview process or in accessing our website may contact us at talent@one.app.
