## Description

 **Who we are**

  

We're building a prayer and meditation app. One that is authentically Christian and Catholic, while at the same time a resource for anyone looking to grow deeper in a relationship with God. We believe that people are hungry for peace, and that there is no surer way to find it than by learning to sit in silence with Christ: “Come to me, all you that are weary and are carrying heavy burdens, and I will give you rest” (Mt 11:28).

  

Our goal is to build something truly great. Something that combines the beauty of the Church’s spirituality with world-class product and content execution.

  

We launched the app in December of 2018 and have been blown away with the incredible growth & traction. Hallow has been downloaded over 15 million times with over 250,000 5-star reviews. We're blessed to be backed by some of the best mission-driven investors in the world and are excited to build out the team to help a lot more folks grow closer to God.

  

We are a startup. We move quickly and take big swings. We are a small and fast moving team and each person is responsible for making an impact. It is hard work, but also deeply meaningful. We’d be honored & humbled if you’d consider joining us.

  

**Tldr:** We are scaling up our dev team quickly and looking for someone to help us grow and expand our back-end.

### What You'll Do

*  **Build out the product functionality:** Craft scalable and fast APIs for our mobile apps, build out tools to process media and schedule content and create recommendation algorithms to engage users with content specific to them.
*  **Debug:** Help debug, triage and solve issues that come in from our customer success and content teams.
*  **Craft tooling and flows:** Build internal tooling to help our teams manage & create new types of content, process & distribute audio, and simplify editing workflows.

  

### What You'll Love

*  **Mission:** This work is incredibly humbling. Every day we hear amazing stories and we get the pleasure of working on something that’s impacting lives. One of our favorite user quotes: “I hate quoting an old, overused cliche, but I’ve been very lost. And I think for the first time in a while I may be found.”
*  **Ownership:** When a company is this small, every employee is a core team member with an outsized impact. You'll own the entire codebase for your vertical within a product pod from start to finish.
*  **Growth:** You’ll get to journey with a VC-backed Silicon Valley startup in hyper-growth mode. who is expected to help build the company as a whole as we settle into a culture and continue to expand the team. From day 1, you’ll be a part of the startup journey. We went from less than 10 to over 60 in the past 2 years, and we’ll need your help to create a world-class team and get individuals praying in more countries around the world.
*  **Flexibility:** We operate as a largely remote team with members all over the globe. This role is a remote role except for our couple in person company planning meetings each year. We don’t care when or where you work just that it gets done. That being said, our HQ is in Chicago and if in person work is something you are interested in we’d love to have you there!
*  **Comp:** We pay competitive market rates both in terms of equity, cash, & benefits. 

  

### What We're Looking For

*  **Passion:** First and foremost, we’re looking for someone excited and passionate about our mission. It makes it a lot more fun to actually care about what you’re working on!
*  **Experience:** A foundation of 1-2 years of experience in Javascript or TypeScript (primarily NodeJS); 1-2 years working on backend systems specifically; experience building scalable, resilient and secure applications; knowledge of application architecture and design; experience with SQL, specifically MySQL; experience building APIs and working with Web-sockets; experience working with AWS;
*  **Grit & Detail-Oriented:** We really care about what we’re doing & try to build as fast as we can. Since we’re guided meditation and competing with some large players in the market (Calm, Headspace), we have to stand out. Everything we do, say, send, or spend money on should be top-notch quality and set Hallow apart as the best.

  

We are honored that you'd consider joining the team and look forward to connecting with you.

  

Best,

  

Alex at Hallow

CEO & Co-Founder
