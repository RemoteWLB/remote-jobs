You will work closely with scrum teams focused on partnerships and their integrations with patient and provider surface areas, as well as core infrastructure patterns that support all engineering teams.

Weâ€™re standing up the technical foundation that will power the future of the company. It doesnâ€™t matter if you donâ€™t have experience with the specific technologies in our stack, weâ€™d still love to connect with you! on the foundational engineering infrastructure at a company where the business is already humming and we have thousands of users every day.
