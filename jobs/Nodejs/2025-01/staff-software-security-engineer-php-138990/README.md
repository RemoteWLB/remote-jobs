You will be working primarily on our MediaWiki platform which powers Wikipedia. As a top 10 website, we must meet stringent performance standards while addressing new security challenges such as supporting modern authentication technologies, detecting and preventing platform abuse from bots, and planning and rolling out improvements to our security architecture by defending against emerging security threats.

**You are responsible for:**

  * Help design and build MediaWiki security capabilities
  * Mentor and lead a security development team
  * Review and deploy security features developed by the Foundation and community members

  * Perform security maintenance and address technical debt in security-critical components
  * Provide support for application security incidents and operations

  * +8 years of experience in the software engineering area with a focus on security
  * Ability to work effectively in a modern, object-oriented PHP code-base
  * Experience developing client-side JavaScript

  * Sensitivity to the security challenges faced by participants in a large, international project
  * Experience using Linux at the command line for tasks related to web application development and deployment
  * Ability to maintain focus when working remotely

**Additionally, weâ€™d love it if you have:
