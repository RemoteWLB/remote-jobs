We believe that mental health is just as important as physical health. We recognize that mental health issues can be complex and multifaceted, and we are dedicated to treating the whole person, not just the symptoms.

We aim to create a world where mental health is no longer stigmatized or marginalized, but rather is embraced as an integral part of one's overall well-being.

We believe that by providing quality care that is both evidence-based and compassionate, we can empower individuals to take charge of their mental health and achieve their full potential. We are passionate about making a positive impact on the lives of those struggling with mental health issues and we strive to be a force for positive change in the field of mental healthcare.

 **About the Engineering Team**

Join Our Engineering Team and Shape the Future of Healthcare Technology! Our dedicated team is revolutionizing mental healthcare with comprehensive Provider and Patient Portals, empowering providers and patients alike. As we transition to a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), you'll play a key role in reshaping our systems, ensuring agility and scalability. In our event-driven architecture, we're navigating challenges to protect sensitive data. With the introduction of GraphQL, a Centralized Component Library, and an Authorization Service, you'll be part of our innovative strides. Join us in shaping healthcare's future and making a difference!

 **About the Role**

  * Rula's mission is to make mental healthcare work for everyone: patients, therapists, and healthcare systems. As a member of Rula’s Patient Experience team, you'll be shaping the patient experience and helping them to manage their care and interact with their therapists; an essential component of the Rula experience. 

  * We are looking for candidates who are interested in working in a close-knit team within a fast-growing product. 

  * As a Staff Engineer, you will get to work across all of Rula's stack, both by contributing directly to our product and its development, as well as by driving meaningful technical conversations and solution-oriented decisions.

 **Required Qualifications**

  * 8+ year of software engineering experience 

  * Experience working on cross-functional teams to bridge the gap between technical and non-technical groups

  * Fullstack experience building modern database-backed (sql/no-sql) web applications

  * Experience with microservice development 

  * Experience mentoring others, reviewing architectures, and establishing design patterns. 

  * Experience driving all phases of the development lifecycle: planning, specing, execution, and measuring success, post-launch maintenance

  * Experience working on highly complex projects with a focus on achieving sustainable results

 **Preferred Qualifications**

 _While having the preferred qualifications enhances your candidacy, having all of them is not mandatory. We encourage all interested applicants to apply, even those who may not meet every preferred requirement._

  * Start-up experience

  * Experience developing SaaS applications using the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform

  * Previous experience in products with high reliability/accuracy requirements (finance, mission critical systems, etc.)

  * Experience with “on-call”, ability to deep dive complex issues and drive them to resolution independently

  * Experience with NodeJs, Typescript, Kafka

 **Technical Stack**

Path's systems are written in Typescript/Node.js or Ruby on Rails, with React frontends. We use Postgres for our databases and everything is hosted on AWS. We also make heavy use of existing tools like Salesforce, Airtable, Typeform, etc. This has enabled us to scale very quickly with a small team but we’re now ready to bring much of this work in-house. We’re standing up the technical foundation that will power the future of the company. It doesn’t matter if you don’t have experience with the specific technologies in our stack, we’d still love to connect with you!

**We're serious about your well-being! As Part Of Our Team, Full-Time Employees Receive**

  * 100% remote work environment from anywhere in the US

  * Competitive pay and benefits that don’t change based on location

  * Health benefits: medical, dental, vision, life, disability, and FSA/HSA 

  * Access to our 401(k) plan

  * Generous time off policies, including 2 company-wide shutdown weeks each year (for most employees) to focus on self-care

  * Paid parental leave

  * Employee Assistance Program (EAP)
