We believe that by providing quality care that is both evidence-based and compassionate, we can empower individuals to take charge of their mental health and achieve their full potential. We are passionate about making a positive impact on the lives of those struggling with mental health issues and we strive to be a force for positive change in the field of mental healthcare.

 **About the Role**

  * Rula's mission is to make mental healthcare work for everyone: patients, therapists, and healthcare systems. As a member of Rula’s Provider Access team, you’ll focus on building delightful software solutions to help therapists onboard onto Rula's system, and get to helping patients as quickly and seamlessly as possible.

  * We are looking for candidates who are interested in working on a small team within a fast-growing product. 

  * We are currently a team of 4 generalists looking to expand to 6. As an engineer on the provider access team, you will get to work in a collaborative environment where you’ll get to drive meaningful technical conversations, make solution-oriented decisions, and own technical solutions end to end.

  * 3+ year of software engineering experience

  * Experience working on cross-functional teams

  * Fullstack experience building modern database-backed (sql/no-sql) web applications

  * Experience with Microservice development

  * Experience driving all phases of the development lifecycle: planning, specing, execution, and measuring success. With an emphasis on the later stages of a project

 **Technical Stack**

Path's systems are written in Typescript/Node.js or Ruby on Rails, with React frontends. We use Postgres for our databases and everything is hosted on AWS. We also make heavy use of existing tools like Salesforce, Airtable, Typeform, etc. This has enabled us to scale very quickly with a small team but we’re now ready to bring much of this work in-house. We’re standing up the technical foundation that will power the future of the company. It doesn’t matter if you don’t have experience with the specific technologies in our stack, we’d still love to connect with you!
