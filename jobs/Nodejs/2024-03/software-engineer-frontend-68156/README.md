### Job Description

Our engineering team solves one of the most important problems of the modern economy - connecting great people with great jobs. We believe this problem can only be solved with technology, and we developed a software platform that has supported over 100M job seekers to date (with 5M joining every month). We are looking for a Frontend Engineer to help us build the next chapter of that vision.

We designed our R&D structure based on the empowered product teams model. It means our teams are responsible for business outcomes and have autonomy in solving problems in the way that “customers love yet work for the business” (yes, we are heavily influenced by this and this).

The graphic interface of our system is based on micro frontend architecture that consists of dozens of applications built using modern technologies: Angular and Node.js. Shared pieces of the system are built using web components. We have a strong CI/CD culture, and we currently run 40 production deployments per engineer per month.

### What you’ll deliver:

  * Contribute to a full life-cycle of the product (including problem discovery, prototyping, design, implementation, and measuring adoption)
  * Design and develop software with Angular and Node.js as a backend for frontend
  * Work closely with designers to build rich end-to-end user experiences
  * Collaborate with other experience and platform teams

### Qualifications

  * Good command of JavaScript programming language
  * While not strictly required we see most of our Software Engineers have 3+ years of professional experience
  * Hands-on experience with clean code principles
  * Experience with professional software engineering practices (e.g. testing, code reviews, design documents)
  * Experience with Angular (we use Angular 14+)
  * Familiarity with Node.js ecosystem would be an advantage
  * Familiarity with multiple parts of the web technology stack (e.g. HTTP, caching, security, debugging)
  * Experience with accessibility, usability, and performance of a browser-based user experience.
  * Familiarity with any modern CSS methodology
  * Great communication skills with a good understanding of English, both verbal and written
