Description

# **About Us**

Qualio is on a mission to empower life science teams to launch and scale life-saving products. We’re doing that by building a connected and integrated quality management platform for the entire life science ecosystem. Qualio is trusted by 100s of highly regulated international customers, ranging from the bleeding edge of computational biology and machine learning to household names in mRNA vaccine development.

The Qualio team is all-remote, and currently distributed across North America, Europe and Australia.

### **Who are we?**

At Qualio, the engineering department is responsible for the "what" and the "how". "What" as in what should we build for our customers. "How" as in how do we delivery and operate the solution.

We are working on building a platform team providing horizontal services to vertical feature centric product teams to deliver on Qualio's brand promise - "An easy, scalable and trusted QMS".

### **How do we work?**

We are designing our teams to own specific horizontal areas of our application. Teams are made up of a Product manager (PM), Engineering team lead and a team of engineers. Owning the area of application means everything, collaborating with product managers, customer success partners, architecture, peer engineering teams to deliver robust cloud-based solutions that drive powerful experiences to our customers.

As Werner Vogels says, "You build it, you run it".

### **What do we value?**

In order to make this a reality we value a number of things:

  * Iterative development - Solutions are delivered as a collection of small pieces. No big bangs.
  * Test driven development
  * Clean code
  * Automation in all its forms - tests, infrastructure, build and deploy - everything
  * "Done" means it's in the hands of customers

# **What’s the opportunity?**

As Qualio continues to grow, we are looking for a Full Stack Engineer to join one of our platform teams. We have a new feature area that is growing beyond an MVP.

We are predominantly a Python shop, but we also use Node.js, TypeScript, React, AngularJS, REST APIs and host our cloud software in AWS, but we’re open to developers who have expertise in different languages as long as you're open to learning!

  * Ability to maintain a proactive and positive attitude in a fast-paced, changing environment
  * You like the sound of working for a fully remote-based organization with lots of opportunities

  * Opportunity to make a difference through helping life-saving products to get to market

# **A note to candidates:**

Studies have shown that women and people of color are less likely to apply for jobs unless they believe they meet every single one of the qualifications as described in a job description. We are committed to building a diverse and inclusive company and we are most interested in finding the BEST candidate for the job. That candidate may be one who comes from a less traditional background, and that’s okay. We would strongly encourage you to apply, even if you don't believe you meet every one of the qualifications described.
